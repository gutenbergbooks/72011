</div>

<span class="fs80">HOW POSEY CAME ADRIFT</span></h2>

<p>Out in the open country the day was dull
and grey, with low-hanging clouds and occasional
drops of slow-falling rain, but in the
city the clouds of smoke hung still lower than
those of the sky, and the dropping soot-flakes
made black the moisture gathered on the
roofs of the houses, the leaves of the trees,
and the sidewalks trodden by many feet.</p>

<p>It was on a city street, one where the
smoke-clouds from the tall chimneys trailed
low and the soot fell in its largest flakes, that
ever and again a sound asserted itself above
the beat of hurrying feet. The sound was
not loud, only a little girl sobbing softly to
herself as she shrank with her head on her
arm at one side of an open stairway; and
the words that she repeated over and over to
herself, “What shall I do? Where shall I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
go?” were less in the nature of questions
than a lamentation. But children tearful,
loudly, even vociferously tearful, were in that
vicinity so frequent that people passed and
repassed the child without giving to her
thought or heed.</p>

<p>For the street was one more populous than
select, and while the tall red brick houses that
bordered it had once aspired to something of
the aristocratic, they were now hopelessly
sunken to the tenement stage; while the neighboring
region leading through the sandy open
square of the Haymarket, where loads of hay
always stood awaiting purchasers, down the
long steep hill to the river, with its crowded
shipping and its border of great lumber
yards, shops, and factories, had never made
pretense to anything except poverty of the
most open and unattractive kind. In summer
the whole region fairly swarmed with
the overflowing inmates of the overcrowded
houses. Children were everywhere, in large
part barefooted, ragged, and so dirty that
they might easily have been taken for an outgrowth
of the sandheaps in which they burrowed
and buried themselves when tired of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
the delights of the street. To see them there,
in utter indifference to the constant passing
of heavily loaded teams sometimes prompted
the inquiry as to how many were daily killed?
But though, on occasion, they were dragged
from under the very horses’ hoofs by the untidy
women whose shrill voices were so often
heard sounding from open doors and windows,
few were the accidents to either life
or limb.</p>

<p>The not distant city market house increased
the crowds, especially at certain hours of the
day, as also the street venders and itinerants
who contributed their full share to the noise
and confusion. Hook-nosed old men, with
bags over their shoulders, and shrill cries of
“P-a-p-e-r r-a-g-s” abounded; the organ-grinder
with his monkey was a frequent figure,
with the invariable crowd of youngsters
at his heels; the maimed and the blind, wearing
placards appealing to the public sympathy
and extending tin cups for contributions,
were to be found on the corners; the
scissors-grinder’s bell was a common sound,
as were the sonorous offers of “Glassputin.”
Here was a man loudly and monotonously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
appealing to the credulity of the public, and
soliciting patronage for his wonderful fortune-telling
birds, a little company of dingy
and forlorn-looking canaries, who by the selection
of sundry envelopes were supposed to
reveal the past, present, and future. There,
another man exhibited a row of plates with
heavy weights attached, and extolled the wonderful
merits of his cement for mending
crockery, while the sellers of small wares,
combs, pocketbooks, letter-paper, cheap jewelry,
and the like, added their calls to the
rest.</p>

<p>A few of the houses still retained a dingy
scrap of yard, where thin and trampled grass
blades made an effort to grow, but the most
part had been built out to the street and converted
into cheap restaurants, cheap clothing
shops, cheap furniture shops, and the class of
establishments that are cheap indeed, especially
as regards the character of their wares.</p>

<p>In such a confusion of people and sounds
it is not strange that a small girl crying to
herself would attract so little attention that
even the big, fat policeman on that beat
passed her a number of times before he noticed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
her, and then did not stop, as he saw that
she was well dressed. At last, as she still
remained crouched down in a dejected little
heap, he stopped, moved as much by the
thought of a little girl in his own home as
from a sense of duty, with the inquiry,
“Here, Sis, what’s the matter with you?”</p>

<p>She started up at the brusque but not unkindly
tone, and lifting from her sheltering
arm a round and dimpled face, with wide grey
eyes, now swollen and disfigured with tears,
answered brokenly and in a half-frightened
voice, for the policeman stood to her as the
terror rather than the guardian of the law,
“Oh, I don’t know what to do! I don’t know
where to go!”</p>

<p>“You don’t, eh? Well, it seems to me you
are a pretty big girl to get lost; where do you
live?”</p>

<p>“I don’t live anywhere,” with a fresh sob.</p>

<p>“That’s rather queer, not to live anywhere,”
and he looked at her a trifle more
sternly. “What’s your name, if you have
any?”</p>

<p>“Posey Sharpe.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed,” and he glanced at the stairway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
before him, where a small black sign with
gilt lettering on the step just above her head
read,</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent">
“Madam Atheldena Sharpe,<br>
“CLAIRVOYANT.”
</p>
<br>

<p>“So that was your mother, was it, who
raised all that row here last night?”</p>

<p>“No, she wasn’t my mother, but I lived
with her.”</p>

<p>“If she wasn’t, how comes it your name is
the same?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t, really, only I’ve lived with her so
long that people called me that. She said
I was her niece, but I wasn’t any relation at
all.”</p>

<p>He looked at the sign again, “Madam
Sharpe. Well,” with a chuckle at his own
witticism, “she wasn’t sharp enough to keep
from being exposed. And you were the
spirit child, I suppose?”</p>

<p>Posey nodded, a very dejected-looking
spirit she seemed at that moment.</p>

<p>“Well, when she took herself off so suddenly
why didn’t you go with her?”</p>

<p>“I ran up under the roof and hid, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
didn’t know till this morning that she had
gone.”</p>

<p>“I see; and was she so good to you, and
did you think so much of her that you are
taking on this way?”</p>

<p>Posey hesitated a moment. “She might
have been better, and she might have been
worse,” she answered with a candor of simplicity.
“But I haven’t anybody else to live
with, and I didn’t think she’d use me so.”</p>

<p>“I see; it was rather rough.” There was
sympathy in his tone, and even in the way he
tapped his knee with his polished club.</p>

<p>“And,” continued Posey, “this morning
the man who owns the place came and he was
awfully mad and cross. He said Madam
Sharpe owed him for rent, and that she had
hurt the reputation of the building, and he
told me to put my things in my trunk, and he
shoved it out into the hall and told me to clear
out, and he locked the door so I couldn’t go in
again. And I haven’t had any dinner, nor I
haven’t a cent of money, nor anywhere to go,
and I don’t know what’ll become of me,” and
she wrung her hands with another burst of
tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>Here was the cause of her misery—the semblance
of home, care, and protection, poor
though it was, had been suddenly stricken
away, leaving her a helpless, solitary estray,
a bit of flotsam at the mercy of the world’s
buffeting currents. Nor was her misery
softened by even the dubious bliss of ignorance
that most children enjoy as to the
sterner realities of life, for already in her
eleven years she had learned only too well
what poverty implies, and how sad a thing it
is to be friendless and homeless.</p>

<p>Poor little Posey, with her soft eyes, dimpled
mouth, and rosy face, she seemed made
for sunshine and caresses. Scant indeed,
however, had been her measure of either.
Her earliest remembrance had been of a home
of two rooms in a tenement, a poor place,
from which her father was often absent, and
sometimes returned with an unsteady step;
but a home which held the greatest earthly
gift, a loving, tender mother. She was a pale,
sweet, sad-faced young mother, who shed
many tears, and lavished on her little daughter
all the wealth of love the heart can bestow
on its one treasure. But as time went by she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
grew thinner and paler, the flush on her cheek
deeper, and her cough sharper, more frequent,
till even Posey, with a child’s apprehension,
would throw her little arms around
her neck, with a vague fear of what she could
not have told herself. Then came a time
when her mother could not rise from her bed;
and at last, when Posey was six years old, the
thread of life that had been so long failing
suddenly snapped.</p>

<p>When the mother realized that the end was
at hand she called her child to her and kissed
her again and again. “Darling,” she said,
holding her to her as though mother-love
would prove itself stronger than even death,
“Mamma is going away, going to leave you.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going to, Mamma?”</p>

<p>“God wants me to come to Him, to
heaven.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t go!” and Posey clung to her,
frightened both by her look and tone. “Don’t
leave me, take me with you if you go.”</p>

<p>“Mamma cannot, dear, though she would,
oh, so gladly. But I want you to listen now,
and though you are only a little girl, never,
never forget what I am saying. Be good,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
wherever you are try to be good, always tell
the truth, always be honest, and every night
say the prayer I have taught you; remember
that mamma has gone to heaven and will wait
for you; and above all remember, remember
always, that God loves you and will take care
of you.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where my husband is?” she
asked a little later of the neighboring woman
who was caring for her.</p>

<p>“No, but I can try and find him.” In her
own mind she thought it would be no difficult
task.</p>

<p>“It’s no matter,” was the weary answer of
the wife, who had sadly learned long before
that her husband’s presence was slight cause
for happiness. “Tell him good-by for me,
and to send a letter he will find in my workbox
to my mother; so she will know that I
asked her forgiveness before I died. And I
want her, as I know she will for my sake, to
take my child.”</p>

<p>Her voice that had been growing weaker
and weaker failed as she whispered the last
word. A slight coughing-fit followed, there
were a few fluttering breaths, and the nurse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
who had been holding her hand laid it softly
down.</p>

<p>“Oh, what is the matter with my mamma?”
cried Posey in a frightened tone. “What
makes her look so white; and lie so still?
Mamma, Mamma, speak to me, do!”</p>

<p>But the ear that had always listened to her
slightest call, would hear her no more. And
the woman lifting kindly in her arms the now
motherless child, terror-stricken and sobbing,
though too young to understand the great
loss and sorrow that had come to her, carried
her gently from the room.</p>

<p>When the absent husband at last came home
and was told his wife’s last message he listened
to it moodily. “I don’t know any great
reason she had to ask her mother’s forgiveness,
just because she married me,” he said.
“I’m not the worst man in the world, by a
long way, if her mother did make such a fuss
about it. And as for letting her have Posey
to bring up and set against me, I’ll do nothing
of the kind. I can take care of my own child,
and I shall do it.”</p>

<p>A natural and praiseworthy sentiment, this
last, had he been a sober, industrious man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
but unfortunately for himself and all connected
with him he was neither. As a consequence,
in the days that followed his little
girl suffered much from neglect, and often
from privation. Sometimes he feasted her on
candy and sweetmeats till she was almost
sick, and again, and more often, he left her
to fare as best she might, and go hungry unless
some neighbor fed her, while many were
the nights she lay awake trembling in the
darkness in her little bed, afraid of the dark,
and almost more afraid of hearing the unsteady
steps that would announce a drunken
father.</p>

<p>But when her mother had been dead less
than a year, there was a disturbance one evening
in a near-by saloon. Revolvers were
used, and one man, present but not involved
in the quarrel, was fatally wounded. Posey
never saw her father again. Taken to a hospital,
public charity cared for him in his last
hours and laid him in his grave. When they
came to tell his child of his death they found
her playing merrily with a doll she had made
for herself of a rolled-up apron and a little
shoulder-shawl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>It was hardly to be expected that she would
comprehend her loss. For that matter, she
hardly knew that she had met with one, and
Mrs. Malone, across the hall, was decidedly
of the opinion that she had not. For her
mother she had grieved long and passionately;
that her father was gone made but
slight impression. She had received from
him so little of affection that she did not miss
its absence, and as to kindness and care, she
had as much from the neighbors.</p>

<p>For a time she was passed from one to another
of these, sharing the proverbial charity
of the poor, minding babies, running errands,
and doing such little tasks as her years and
strength permitted. There was a kind-hearted
reluctance among these humble
friends to handing her over to public charity.
A remembrance of her mother’s wish for her
still lingered, and Mrs. Malone even tried to
find the letter she had spoken of, but no doubt
her husband had destroyed it. There was occasional
talk of an effort to find this grandmother,
but Posey knew nothing of her whereabouts,
every one else was equally ignorant,
and it never went beyond the talk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>It was at this time that Posey came under
the notice of Madam Atheldena Sharpe, a
lady who was making her wits provide her
support, and who was quick to see how a
pretty and easily taught child might be a help
towards that end. To her taking possession
of Posey there was no one to object. None
of the few people she knew felt able to assume
the burden of her support. To most of
them the clairvoyant with her showy manners
and fine-sounding phrases seemed a very imposing
person, and Posey was counted a fortunate
child to have found such a protector.</p>

<p>So Posey entered on the second phase of
her life, bearing with her pitifully few mementos
of her vanished home—a china dog
her father had bought her in an unwontedly
generous mood, a book of children’s poems,
out of which her mother had read to her and
taught her to read, a locket that had belonged
to her mother, and her pocket Bible.</p>

<p>It was but a short time till new attractions
were added to “Madam’s” <em>séances</em>—mysterious
bells rang, an equally mysterious
tambourine was tinkled; and presently out of
a cabinet, that now made part of the furnishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
of the room, appeared what was understood
to be a spirit materialized, an ethereal-looking
little figure in the dim light, with long
golden hair and floating white draperies.</p>

<p>As to the question of right or wrong in all
this the child gave little thought. At first
she had been too young and the various details
had been but so many tasks; then as she
grew older and began to realize the humbug
behind that needed such constant and careful
guarding from discovery, she was inclined
to laugh at people for being so easily duped.
But in the main it was to her simply a means
of living, the way in which their bread and
butter came.</p>

<p>For the ignorance of most children as to
the value of money, or its need in daily life
had with Posey been early and sadly dispelled.
Better than many an older person
she understood not only its necessity but how
to make the most of it. From behind some
door or curtain she would watch the people
as they came to consult the clairvoyant, or
gathered for a <em>séance</em>, as eagerly as the
“Madam” herself; she knew exactly what
each would add to the family purse, and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
could tell pretty well in advance if the next
day’s dinner would be scanty or plenty, and
whether the medium would be pleasant or the
contrary. For though not destitute of kindly
impulses her mood was apt to vary in large
measure with her success.</p>

<p>In their changing life Posey was soon far
from the city where she had lived, and finding
her of even more value than she had expected
Madam Sharpe gave to the child her own
name, and took all possible pains to efface all
remembrance of her earlier life, at the same
time impressing on her the fact of her homeless
and friendless condition, and that but
for her kindness she would be a little beggar
on the street; so that, as was her intention,
Posey grew into the belief that Madam
Atheldena Sharpe was all that stood between
her and absolute distress, and with that picture
constantly before her she yielded the
more readily to that lady’s frequent exactions
and petulance.</p>

<p>That she might become still more valuable,
she was sent to school whenever their stay
in a place permitted, though seldom was that
long enough for the forming of friendships.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
Indeed Madam Sharpe did not encourage
such, for though singularly trusty, still she
was always afraid that to other children
Posey might be tempted to betray some jealously
guarded secrets. For this reason, fortunately
for her, Posey was never allowed
the freedom of the streets, or the acquaintance
of the children among whom she was
thrown.</p>

<p>As soon as she grew old enough the
“Madam” made her useful in domestic matters.
She was taught to sweep and dust the
rooms, to go to market, to prepare their simple
meals, and to attend to most of the “light
housekeeping” which best suited Madam
Sharpe’s finances and business. In the evenings
if people enough came to form a “circle”
she had her part to take in the “manifestations,”
which was to her only another
of her daily tasks, and when ended she was
quickly and gladly in bed and asleep.</p>

<p>So Posey’s life was by no means an idle
one. She had enough to do to fill the most of
her time, and for the rest, though often she
was lonely and longed for companionship,
still she had been accustomed from a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
child to amusing herself and so had acquired
numberless resources to that end. Perhaps
the most important result of this way of life
was the distinctness in which it kept her
mother’s memory, which might have faded
had existence for her been happier or less
monotonous. Facts and events grew blurred
and indistinct, but her mother remained as
vivid as a living presence.</p>

<p>No doubt with time imagination added its
share till the remembrance grew into her ideal
of all that was true and pure and lovely, as it
was her greatest solace and comfort. Her
words, except those last ones fixed by the
solemnity of death, she did not so much remember,
but the tenor of her mother’s teachings,
her influence, her personality, were indelibly
stamped on her mind. In every grief
her first impulsive thought was, “Oh, my
mamma!” as though even that mute appeal
was a consolation; while the reflection,
“Would Mamma like to have me?” influenced
her actions more than the actual presence of
many a living mother. Never a night did she
omit to kneel and repeat the prayer she had
learned at her knee. Though she had long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
known them all by heart, she never grew tired
of the book of child’s poems out of which her
mother had read to her. Often of an evening
sitting alone and lonely, out of her vague
and fragmentary memories she would try to
recall the songs she had sung and the stories
she had told her; and many a night when the
day had been hard in her small world did she
cry herself to sleep with the yearning plaint
on her lips, “I do so want to see my mamma!”
All this had the effect of keeping her
strangely pure, and through the atmosphere
of sordid deceit, if not worse, that surrounded
her she walked as if guided and led by the
mother-hand so long still and folded.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br>
<span class="fs80">AN EXPOSURE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>This phase of her life continued till Posey
was nearly twelve. At first in the spirit-manifestations
she had simply followed the clairvoyant’s
directions, but as she became older
she not only learned to make herself up for
the occasions, but to introduce little variations
of her own, which added not a little to
the interest and popularity of the <em>séances</em>.
Gradually, too, she came to take a certain
personal pride in her rôle, of amusement at
her own cleverness, and of elation at the sensation
she created. As for the moral question,
that held no place; she was simply a little
actress playing well her part, with an under
thought of the profits.</p>

<p>In the earlier days when the “Madam” had
both to dress her, and teach her every detail,
she had only been able to appear in one “manifestation,”
but now she could manage several,
and frequently appeared in succession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
as an Indian princess, a French girl, and
“little Nellie of the Golden Hair.” For the
French girl, “Madam” had her take French
lessons so that her replies could be in that
language, and on occasions when all the “influences”
were favorable she would sing very
softly and sadly a little French song, accompanying
herself on a “materialized” guitar.</p>

<p>For a long time she never ventured outside
the cabinet, but gaining boldness with practice
she at last came into the room, hovering
near the circle gathered round the table, and
answering any question put her by the clairvoyant,
who at such times was always in a
trance.</p>

<p>Madam Sharpe was greatly elated by all
this, and to her fancy new, brilliant, and
profitable successes seemed opening before
her. Alas, in this very increase of popularity,
and with it of public attention, lay her
undoing, as it drew to her <em>séances</em> not only
the easily credulous, and the sincere believers,
but the doubting skeptics whose purpose
was investigation.</p>

<p>So it came one evening that several young
men of the latter class, including a newspaper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
reporter, were present, and after the lights
had been turned low and dim, and the thrill
of hushed expectancy had settled over the
waiting circle, and out of the slowly opening
door of the cabinet a white, shadowy little
figure had lightly floated, and as the “spirit”
passed near the newspaper reporter he
adroitly threw a pinch of snuff in its face.</p>

<p>A sneeze followed, a most decidedly human
sneeze. Quick as thought he seized it in a
strong grasp, while another of the “investigators”
as quickly turned the gas high and
bright, and then and there was revealed to
that astounded circle a plump, round-faced,
very flesh-and-blood little girl, with the white
powder partly rubbed off her rosy face, her
wig of long, floating, yellow hair awry, and
her white gauze dress crumpled and torn;
frightened, angry, and stoutly struggling to
escape. As soon as she saw that exposure
had come Madam Sharpe hastily made her
escape, and a moment later Posey managed
to free herself from the hand of her captor
and darted from the room.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="032" style="max-width: 41.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/032.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Out of the door of the cabinet a white, shadowy little

</figure>
<br>

<p>But evidence enough remained: the cabinet,
that through a sliding panel opened into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>an adjoining room, the guitar, the wigs, the
costumes of the different “materializations.”</p>

<p>A storm of indignation naturally followed
these discoveries, a storm so loud as to arouse
the attention of all in the vicinity, and to
bring a policeman to the scene. An angry
but fruitless search was made for the clairvoyant,
who was near enough to hear the
threats expressed as she cowered in her place
of retreat.</p>

<p>A much duller comprehension than hers
would have realized that her career in that
city was ended. Reporters, as she well
knew, would catch it up, and the morning papers
spread the news of her exposure far and
wide, even should she escape the arrest she
had heard threatened on the ugly charge
of obtaining money under false pretenses.
While the crowd was still surging through
her rooms, she had decided that the sooner
she was away the better; and as soon as the
neighborhood regaining quiet had sunk into
slumber, she secured, as hastily and secretly
as possible, the removal of her few personal
effects, and, thanks to the express speed of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
the railroad, was many miles distant when
morning dawned.</p>

<p>Angry though she was at Posey, the innocent
cause of the trouble, yet had the latter
been at hand she would have taken her in
her flight. But Posey up in the attic, to
which she had fled and from which she had
not dared to venture, had fallen asleep on a
soft heap of rubbish, and Madam Atheldena
Sharpe, now as ever thoroughly selfish, abandoned
with hardly a thought the child who
had so long shared her fortunes. And when
with the morning Posey, waking, crept cautiously
down, her tumbled finery looking
tawdry enough in the daylight, it was to find
only empty, disordered rooms, from which
the clairvoyant and all belonging to her had
vanished.</p>

<p>So for the second time, and with an increased
keenness of apprehension of all it implied,
Posey was again thrown on the world.
And now, for the first time, in the person of
the fat, good-natured policeman, Society, that
great factor of civilization, became aware of
her existence, took her under its charge, and
in due time placed her in the “Children’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
Refuge,” an institution where the city was
already providing for some two or three hundred
similar waifs and strays.</p>

<p>This was a new, strange home indeed, and
at the same time a statelier one than she had
ever known—the tall brick building, with its
great wings, one the boys’ and the other the
girls’ department, stretching on either side.
While accustomed as she had been all her life
to a haphazard, makeshift existence, the exquisite
neatness, the perfect order, and the
regular system at first equally amazed and
depressed. Posey had brought with her a
somewhat varied store of accomplishments,
but as she looked at the long rows of girls,
with their neat uniforms of blue dresses and
checked aprons, and noticed the clock-work
regularity of their daily life she felt that she
had much, very much, to learn.</p>

<p>The Refuge was not an institution where
appalling cruelties are hidden under the surface
of smoothness. The children were as
well clothed, well fed, well taught, and well
cared for as is possible where such gathered
numbers make separate mothering almost
impossible. As a necessity, system, regularity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
was the rule; from the rising in the morning
till the retiring at night the ringing of
the great bell ordered all; eating, play, work,
study, was at its monition. And if any tried
rebellion, as Posey at the first sometimes
felt inclined to do, it was speedily to find that
they but bruised themselves against the
strong force which controlled the whole.</p>

<p>Into this routine Posey soon settled; she
had her little white bed in one of the rows of
the long dormitory, her desk in the schoolroom,
her place in the work-room, where at
certain hours in the day the girls worked at
making paper boxes; and her group of friends
in the playground. After the lonely isolation
of most of her previous life it was a great
change, this becoming one in such a multitude.
But hardest of all for her was it to
become used to the pressure of discipline, not
severe but constant, the feeling that she was
never free from the watchful, overlooking eye.</p>

<p>In almost every respect she was much better
off here than when in the hands of Madam
Sharpe, but though never alone, as in the old
days, she was often as lonely as when she sat
secluded in the kitchen-bedroom of the clairvoyant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
lonely for the love, the tenderness,
that her child heart had longed for so long
and so vainly.</p>

<p>After all that Posey had had to do when
with the “Madam” it was not hard for her
to learn to make paper boxes quickly and well.
In the schoolroom, too, she was soon able to
take a place near the head of her class, something
that gave her not a little pride. Rewards
were not offered to the scholars, but
one day a reward came to her that she never
forgot, and that had not a little influence in
shaping her future. It was at the close of a
session when she had acquitted herself with
even more than her usual credit, and Miss
Grey, the teacher, in passing her desk as she
was putting her books in order, stopped with
a pleasant smile and said, “Posey, I am very
glad to see you so ambitious in your studies;
if you will study and try I think you can one
day make a teacher.”</p>

<p>It was to Posey a new idea, and the stirring
of her first real ambition. Was it possible
that she could become a teacher like Miss
Grey, and have pupils who should in like
manner admire her, and, best of all, make a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
place and earn a living for herself? Her
heart thrilled, first with the idea, and again
with the determination that it should be possible.
And Miss Grey, busy with her many
pupils and manifold duties, went her way unconscious
of the ray of promise she had given,
a ray that should shine as a day-star of hope
through many a long day. For that matter,
she had no idea of the feeling she had inspired
in Posey’s heart, how she watched, admired,
and imitated her, absorbed her ideas, was influenced
by her opinions, and when she finally
left, for a home of her own, missed her.</p>

<p>With all the teachers and matrons Posey
was in the main a favorite. But for the
study of individual character there was scant
time; when she was good, little attention was
paid to her, when she was naughty she received
the punishment she had incurred. For
while Posey possessed a certain intrepid
strength of purpose that carried her over
many a hard place, as well as in her work
and lessons, these were coupled with an impulsiveness
of action and warmth of temper
that often brought her into temporary disgrace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>Still, on the whole, the year and a half she
passed at the Refuge was as happy as any
she had spent since her mother’s death. But
one day a summons came for her to the Superintendent’s
office, where sat a stout lady,
with a face of hard, mottled red flesh, one
whom she had noticed a little while before
making the rounds of the rooms.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, regarding Posey with a
fixed gaze of her beady black eyes, “I think
I will try this one. I’ll take her home with
me and keep her for a while, anyway. No,
I don’t care to ask her any questions. I
wouldn’t know much more if I did, and I can
find out enough in short order. So hurry
and get yourself ready,” to Posey, “for I’ve
no time to lose.” And when Posey heard this
she hardly knew whether she ought to be glad
or sorry.</p>

<p>The Refuge did not let its charges go out
without providing as far as possible for their
welfare and future. As Mrs. Hagood had
furnished ample references as to her capability
for such a charge; and as she further
promised to give Posey good care, moral instruction,
and the advantage of the school in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
her village, the Refuge authorities felt that
in this case they had amply done their duty.
So in a very short time Posey’s few belongings
were packed, the parting words said, and
in company with Mrs. Hagood she had passed
and left behind the tall wrought-iron gates of
the Refuge.</p>

<p>To live in the country had always been to
Posey a dream of delight, though her knowledge
of the country was limited to fleeting
views from car windows. She had, too, a
faint memory of stories her mother had once
told her of the happiness of a childhood spent
among orchards and meadows; and with all
these in mind she had often looked at the
dusty trees bordering the stone-paved streets,
and the swift-flowing streams that filled the
gutters after a rain, trying to cheat imagination
into the belief that they were real brooks
and genuine woods.</p>

<p>So now when Mrs. Hagood told her that
her new home was to be in a little country
village her heart beat high with anticipation,
and she decided that she was glad she was
going. On their way to the train in the street
cars they skirted the Haymarket, and Posey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
looked out with mingled feelings at the tall
brick building, the scene of her memorable
misadventure. Not that she had any desire
to return to Madam Sharpe. With a child’s
quick intuition for shams, the clairvoyant’s
manifold deceptions had inspired her with
anything but a profound respect, nor had she
by any means forgotten the cruelty of her desertion.
Besides, was she not now going into
the beautiful country, to be as free as a bird
among the birds and flowers?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br>
<span class="fs80">THE NEW HOME</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Before Posey hardly had time to realize
the change, the city with its crowded houses
and busy streets, its smoke and confusion, its
glitter of wealth, its grime of poverty, was
left behind, and she was seated by the side
of Mrs. Hagood in the cars on her way to her
new home, something over an hour’s ride
distant.</p>

<p>Though yet early in March it was a sunny,
spring-like day. Under the bland air the
snow had almost disappeared from the brown
fields, and only lingered in occasional patches
of white in hollows and along sheltering
fences. The willows by brookside ways were
showing their early catkins, while the woods,
distinct against the tender blue of the spring
sky, by their reddening tinge told that life
was already stirring in the leaf-buds, so soon
to unfold.</p>

<p>In some of the woods that the train sped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
through, Posey caught glimpses of smoke
curling up from small, weather-worn buildings,
while from the trees around them hung
buckets, some painted a bright red, others of
shining tin; she could even now and then hear
from the open car window a musical drip,
drip, which the more increased her wonder.</p>

<p>“What are all those pails hanging to the
trees for?” she finally asked. “And what is
the sound just as though water was dropping?”</p>

<p>“Goodness alive, didn’t you ever see a sugar
bush opened before?” inquired Mrs. Hagood.
“That’s where they are making maple
sugar and syrup; those are maple trees,
and what you hear is the sap running; it’s
been a good sap day, too.”</p>

<p>This explanation did not make the matter
very clear to Posey, but what Mrs. Hagood
meant was that the warmth of the spring day
had caused a rapid upward flow of the sap,
or juice of the tree, which had been stored in
the roots through the winter; and by making
incisions in the tree this sap, which is sweetest
in the maple, is caught and boiled into
syrup or sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>For all the outward attractions, Posey had
already given some very earnest and anxious
looks at Mrs. Hagood, with whom her home
was now to be for an indefinite time. Child
as she was, she quickly felt that there was
nothing of the flimsy, the pretentious, about
that lady. The substantial was stamped on
every feature, and though her shawl was
handsomer and her black silk dress of finer
quality than she had ever seen Miss Grey
wear, she was conscious that Mrs. Hagood
lacked something the little teacher possessed—the
essential quality that made the latter
the true lady.</p>

<p>But the time had been short, or so it
seemed, for the much there was to think and
see, when Mrs. Hagood gathered up her numerous
packages, and Posey found herself
hurried out on the platform of a wayside station.
Truly she was in the country. A few
scattered farmhouses were in sight in the distance,
but the little station stood between the
far-reaching railroad tracks and the muddy
country road wholly apart and alone. No
one but themselves had alighted, and they
were the sole occupants of the building, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
even a station-master appearing in sight.
“Is this a village?” Posey asked as she
looked around in wide-eyed surprise.</p>

<p>“Mercy, no, child, the village is two miles
from here.”</p>

<p>“And what a queer depot,” added Posey.
“I never was in one before where there
weren’t lots of people.”</p>

<p>“People in the country have to stay at
home and work,” was the short reply. Posey
had already noticed that Mrs. Hagood had a
way of clipping her words off short as though
she had no time to waste on them.</p>

<p>“When they do go,” she added, “they
mostly take the morning train, as I did, and
come back later. This train never stops here
unless it has passengers to let off, or some
one flags it to get on.”</p>

<p>As she talked they had walked around the
narrow platform to the opposite side of the
station, and Mrs. Hagood, shading her eyes
with her hand, for the afternoon sun was now
low and level, looked down the road with the
remark, “I should like to know where Elnathan
Hagood is. I told him to be here in
time to meet this train.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>Naturally Posey felt a degree of curiosity
as to the family she was about to enter, and
with Mrs. Hagood’s words came the reflection,
“So, then, she has a boy. I hope I shall
like him.”</p>

<p>A few moments later an open buggy drawn
by a stout, sleek bay horse came in sight over
the nearest hill, whose occupant Posey saw
as it drew near was a small, middle-aged man,
with a pleasant face, mild blue eyes, and a
fringe of thin brown beard, touched with grey,
under his chin.</p>

<p>“I thought, Elnathan,” was Mrs. Hagood’s
greeting as he drew up to the platform,
“that I told you to be here by train-time.”</p>

<p>As Elnathan Hagood climbed slowly out
over the muddy wheel, there was apparent a
slight stoop to his shoulders, and droop to his
hat-brim, and a certain subtle but none the
less palpable air of one who had long been
subjected to a slightly repressive, not to say
depressing influence. “Wal, now, Almiry,”
he remarked with the manner of a man to
whom the apologetic had become habitual, “I
did lay out to be here on time, but the roads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
hev thawed so since morning that it took me
longer than I’d calc’lated on.”</p>

<p>His wife gave a sniff of contempt. “I only
hope I sha’n’t catch my death o’ cold waitin’
here in this raw wind, clear tired out as I be,
too. But now you are here at last, see if you
can put these things in, and not be all the afternoon
about it, either.”</p>

<p>“I see you did get a little girl,” with a nod
and kindly smile at Posey, who stood a little
apart.</p>

<p>“Yes,” rejoined Mrs. Hagood tartly, “I
said I was goin’ to, and when <em>I</em> plan to do
a thing I carry it out <em>as</em> I planned it, and
<em>when</em> I planned it.</p>

<p>“I know,” she continued, regarding Posey
as though she had been a wooden image, or
something equally destitute of hearing, to say
nothing of feeling, “that it’s a big risk to
take one of those street children; you never
know what tricks they have, or what they
may turn out to be. This one isn’t very big,
but she looks healthy, an’ I see she was spry,
an’ I guess I’ll be able to make her earn as
much as her salt, anyway.”</p>

<p>Posey’s cheeks flamed hotly, and she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
on the point of an indignant protest that she
had never been a street child in her life, when
she caught a slight shake of the head from
Mr. Hagood. Then Mrs. Hagood turned
away to direct her husband as he folded a
horse-blanket to form a seat for Posey, at the
same time enveloping herself in a large, black,
shiny waterproof cloak, to protect her from
the mud, and tying a thick brown veil over
her bonnet to serve the same purpose.</p>

<p>When all was ready, Mr. Hagood lifted
Posey into the buggy, with another friendly
smile that went warm to her heart, and as
soon as the various packages with which she
had returned laden, were settled to Mrs. Hagood’s
satisfaction they were on their way.
But they had not driven far when leaning
across Posey, who was seated between them,
Mrs. Hagood snatched the reins from her husband’s
hands, exclaiming, “Elnathan Hagood,
give me those lines, an’ see if <em>I</em> can’t
drive without gettin’ into every mudhole we
come to.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hagood yielded without a word. The
first thought of their wide-eyed young companion
was of wonder that he should do so.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
In her heart she felt that if she were a man
she would not, but as she furtively glanced
from him to his wife, it was with the instinctive
feeling that protest or opposition on his
part would be useless.</p>

<p>On account of the muddy clay road their
progress was but slow, but accustomed only
to city sights, and for so long to the seclusion
of the Refuge, Posey enjoyed every step
of the way. The pleasant farmhouses they
passed, set in their wide, deep yards; the
barns with cattle standing around, chewing
placid cuds and looking at them with large
soft eyes; the full and rushing brooks that
came darting out of the fields with a swirl to
rush across the road into the fields again; the
bits of woods, shadowy and quiet; the soft
brown of the rolling fields; the fresh spring
air, the wide outlook, the very novelty and
strangeness of it all. And to her it seemed
quite too soon that climbing the long hill they
entered the village of Horsham, whose white
church spire had for some time been looking
down on them.</p>

<p>Horsham, like most country villages, consisted
of a central cluster of stores and shops,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
from which radiated a scattering company
of comfortable homes, and all surrounded and
over-arched with imbosoming trees. Presently
the sleek bay horse turned into the yard
of one of the most cosy of these, trim with
white paint and green blinds. At the first
glance Posey saw that everything about the
place was faultlessly neat and tidy; and also
that on the opposite side of the drive, near the
street but in the same yard, was another
and smaller building bearing above its door
a sign,</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent fs80 wsp">
ELNATHAN HAGOOD. WAGONS REPAIRED.<br>
</p>
<br>

<p>She had little time to look around, however,
for Mrs. Hagood, unlocking a side door,
led the way into a large, comfortable kitchen.
Hastily divesting herself of her outer wraps,
she opened the door to a bedroom off from it,
which was only long enough for the bed, and
wide enough to admit at the side of the bed a
washstand and a chair.</p>

<p>“Here, Posey,” she said, “is your room.
You will find it clean and tidy, and I shall expect
you to keep it so. Now take off your
things and hang them on those nails behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
the door, and put on one of your gingham
aprons, that you wore at the Refuge, to keep
your dress clean. Then take that pail on the
corner table to the spring at the end of the
yard and fill it with water. Mind that you
don’t slop it over you, or spill any on the
floor as you bring it in, either. Then fill the
teakettle and put it on to boil, and go out in
the woodhouse and get seven potatoes out
of the basketful on a bench by the door.
Wash them in the tin basin that hangs up over
the sink and put them in the oven to bake.”
Here Mrs. Hagood added some more wood
to that which had burned low in the stove,
opened the draughts and set it to burning
briskly. “By the time you have done that
I will have my dress changed and be back to
show you where to get the things to set the
table.”</p>

<p>Posey had proceeded as far as the filling
of the teakettle when Mr. Hagood entered
and after a glance around the room as if to
assure himself that they were alone drew
from his pocket a handful of apples.
“They’re russets,” he said in a cautious
voice, holding them out to her. “They’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
just got meller an’ I thought mebby you’d
like to keep ’em in your room an’ eat one
when you felt like it.” And Posey gratefully
accepted the good-will offering, and the suggestive
hint implied with it.</p>

<p>After supper she washed up the dishes under
Mrs. Hagood’s supervision, and when
that was done and the lamp lighted gladly sat
down, for she was decidedly tired after the
unwonted events and excitement of the day.
Unless company came, the kitchen was also
the living-room, for Mrs. Hagood said it was
good enough for them, and saved the dirt and
wear of carpets in the front rooms. So Mr.
Hagood drew up to the table with his spectacles
and weekly paper and was soon absorbed
in the latter, while Mrs. Hagood brought out
a blue and white sock, partly finished, which
she attacked vigorously.</p>

<p>Noticing with a glance of disapproval
Posey’s folded hands she asked, “What did
you do evenings at the Refuge?”</p>

<p>“We studied part of the evening, and then
we read, or one of the teachers read to us,
and sometimes we sang, or played quiet
games.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” with emphasis, “I think they had
better been teaching poor children who will
always have to work for their living, something
of some use. Do you know how to
knit?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Then I will set up a stocking of cotton
yarn for you to-morrow and show you how.
When I was your age I knit all my own stockings,
and always had knitting to catch up
when I’d nothing else to do. Girls then
didn’t sit with their hands idle much, I can
tell you,” and her knitting needles clicked
loud and fast.</p>

<p>Thus was Posey introduced to her new
home. And that night as she sat in her tiny
room, in a frame of mind it must be confessed
somewhat depressed by the formidable personality
of Mrs. Hagood, she ate one of the
russet apples, which she had hidden in a
drawer in the stand, and felt cheered and
comforted by the spirit of kindly sympathy
it represented, together with its mute assurance
that in the household she would find at
least one friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
<span class="fs80">THE NEW LIFE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The next morning Posey was awakened by
the voice of Mrs. Hagood at her door, “Come,
Posey; time to get up, and be spry about it,
too.”</p>

<p>The clock was just striking six as she came
out of her room, but the kitchen was already
warm and Mrs. Hagood in a loose calico wrapper
was busy about the breakfast.</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to dawdle in bed,” was
her salutation. “I’m stirring myself mornings
and I want folks about me to stir, too.
Hurry and wash you, then take this dish and
go down cellar for some cucumber pickles.
They are in that row on the left hand side,
the third jar. Now mind and remember, for
I don’t want to keep telling things over to
you.”</p>

<p>As she returned with the pickles Mr. Hagood
came in with a pail of foaming milk, and
Posey, who in her household experience had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
been accustomed to see milk measured by the
pint, or more often the half-pint, gave a little
cry of wonder and delight.</p>

<p>“I want ter know?” and Mr. Hagood’s
thin, kindly face wrinkled from mouth to
eyes in a smile. “Never saw so much milk
as this at once before. Why I get this pail
full every night and morning, and I calc’late
Brindle’ll do still better when she gets out to
grass.” As he spoke he had strained out a
cupful of the fresh, warm milk and handed it
to Posey, saying, “Drink that now, an’ see if
it don’t taste good.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing, Elnathan?” demanded
Mrs. Hagood, who was skillfully
turning some eggs she was frying.</p>

<p>“Wal, now, Almiry, I’m just givin’ the
child what she never had before in her life,
a drink o’ fresh, warm milk. I thought, Almiry,”
with an accent of mild reproof, “you’d
like her to have what milk she wanted to
drink.”</p>

<p>“You know as well as anybody,” was her
tart retort, “that I never scrimped anybody
or anything around me yet of victuals; Posey
can have all the milk she wants to drink with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
her breakfast, but there’s no use for her to
be stoppin’ her work and spendin’ time to
drink it now, or you to be lettin’ the cream
rise on the milk before it’s strained, to watch
her.”</p>

<p>Breakfast out of the way Mrs. Hagood said,
“Now, Posey, you may go out and feed the
chickens. You will find a bag of shelled corn
on the granary floor; give them the basin that
stands on a barrel beside it twice full.”</p>

<p>It was a command that Posey gladly
obeyed, but she wondered that the flock of
eager fluttering chickens, who crowded
around her, and flew up into the granary
door, seemed so indifferent to the breakfast
she scattered for them. “Go and eat,” she
vainly urged, “go!”</p>

<p>Posey had on occasion seen city hens, poor,
dirty, bedraggled fowls, but these were so
different, plump and snowy, bright of eye,
and sleek of plumage, that it was a pleasure
to linger among them. But Mrs. Hagood’s
voice soon sounded from the door, “Posey,
is it going to take you all the forenoon to feed
those hens?”</p>

<p>A little later as Posey was washing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
breakfast dishes, taking great pains to follow
all of Mrs. Hagood’s many directions, for she
truly wished to please, she heard that lady
calling her, and dropping the wiping-towel
ran out into the yard to see what was
wanted.</p>

<p>“How came all those beans here on the
ground?” Mrs. Hagood demanded sharply,
pointing as she spoke to the white kernels
scattered around.</p>

<p>“Why,” replied Posey in surprise, “that
is what I fed the chickens as you told me.”</p>

<p>“‘As I told you!’ A likely story that I
would tell you to feed the hens beans. Don’t
you know enough to know beans from corn?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” retorted Posey hotly.
“And why should I? I never was in the
country before in my life, and I don’t know
anything about corn, except green corn, or
beans, either.”</p>

<p>“Shut right up,” exclaimed Mrs. Hagood
sternly. “I won’t put up with any impudence,
and I want you to make up your mind
to that. Now look here,” holding up a
handful of yellow kernels, “<em>this</em> is corn; remember
it, and if you make such a blunder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
again I’ll help you to remember with a
whip.”</p>

<p>Posey turned slowly and with a swelling
heart re-entered the house. She had meant
no harm, the two bags had sat side by side,
the mistake had been wholly accidental, and
under other circumstances she would have
been sorry enough, but now with the sense of
injustice burning at her heart she said to herself,
“Cross old thing, I don’t care if I did
spill her old beans, not one bit.”</p>

<p>So Posey’s life with Mrs. Hagood began,
and had the latter been an agreeable person
to live with it might have been a pleasant
life; she was comfortably clothed, she had an
abundance of wholesome food, and the work
expected of her was in no way beyond her
strength. But Mrs. Hagood always so managed
that when one task was ended another
was ready to take its place. With her it was
one continuous grind from morning till night;
that the child required a share of pleasure
and recreation was an idea she would have
scouted. <em>She</em> worked all the time, she would
have said, why was it any worse for Posey?
Besides, this was a poor child who would always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
have to earn her living and the sooner
she realized it the better.</p>

<p>So the stocking was set up, and Posey inducted
into the mysteries of knitting. For
other spare moments there were towels to hem
and sheets to turn, and when everything else
failed to fill all the available time there was
always on hand a huge basket of carpet rags
to be cut, sewed, and wound.</p>

<p>With it all she was one of those women
who never dream of bestowing praise: if the
work were ever so well done, and Posey was
at times fired with the ambition to see how
well she could do, never a word of commendation
followed; if on the contrary, there was
any failure, and Mrs. Hagood’s eyes were always
alert for faults, there was always the
word of sharp reproof. Then Posey would
solace herself with the reflection that she
couldn’t suit her if she tried, and she wasn’t
going to try any more, and she hoped she
wouldn’t be suited, “so there!”</p>

<p>Often and often as Posey sat in the open
doorway in the long summer afternoons, the
distant woods beyond the village beckoning
with their green shade and the basket of endless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
carpet rags at her side, did she wish herself
back within the pent-up walls of the
Refuge; for there when her appointed task
was done she could enjoy some free time,
while here was no escape from the atmosphere
of repression, fault-finding, and petty
irritation, to say nothing of the absence of all
love and sympathy, or even interest.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hagood would have said that all she
was doing was for Posey’s interest, but it is
exceedingly doubtful if Almira Hagood ever
viewed anything or any one in a light separate
from her own interest. With a sublime
self-confidence in her own ideas and
opinions, she would unhesitatingly have
crushed a stronger opposition to her will;
how much the more anything so insignificant
as the wishes and feelings of a little charity
girl! One, too, whom she had taken solely
that she might have her work, and whose
highest good therefore was to be useful, as
her highest aim and desire ought to be to do
the work she assigned her quickly and well;
while, unfortunately for both, Posey’s mind
was often filled with a host of other and
widely differing wishes and desires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>Had kindly Mr. Hagood been an active factor
in the domestic economy, her life would
have been very different; but he was only a
passive factor, so passive, in fact, as to be
seldom considered, and least of all by his
wife. From the first Posey had regarded
Mr. Hagood in the light of a fellow sufferer,
with the present advantage of his little shop
to escape to, where with his work as a plea
he managed to spend not only most of his
days but many of his evenings, and where he
could enjoy the pleasure of his pipe and
dog, both forbidden the house, and a frequent
chance visitor. For Mrs. Hagood so
frowned upon his making one of the nightly
group at the village store and post-office that,
social as he was by nature, he seldom ventured
on the enjoyment.</p>

<p>Still if this was his present advantage, he
would always, so Posey reflected, have to live
with Mrs. Hagood, while some glad day she
would be old enough to leave, and then never
need see her again unless she chose, which
she didn’t much think would ever happen.</p>

<p>An amiable, easy-going man, Elnathan Hagood,
it was said, at the time of his marriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
had inclined to ways slightly convivial. But
his wife speedily changed all that, and by the
sheer force of her superior will had set and
kept his feet in a straight path. By nature
“handy” with tools the shop had been her
idea, where she started him as surgeon to the
various disabled vehicles of Horsham; while
she, in the meantime, having taken charge of
his modest patrimony, proceeded to put it out
to usury, in a literal as well as figurative
sense.</p>

<p>In all the country round no one knew how
to drive a sharp bargain, and for that matter
a hard one, better than Almira Hagood; and
woe to the luckless debtor who expected
mercy at her hands. With these qualities
but few really liked Mrs. Hagood; she was
too dominant, positive, selfish, and avaricious
to win many friends, or to care much for
friendship. At the same time, and for all
that her methods were now and then a
shade questionable, there were many who admired
her thrift, energy, business shrewdness,
and practical ability, and took a certain
pride in her success as in some sort reflecting
credit on her home village.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>It is almost needless to say that in the
twenty years or more she had managed the
property it had greatly increased in value,
and at this time included outlying farms, village
property, bank stock, mortgages, and
sundry other investments. In regard to this
she never thought of consulting her husband,
and if he ever ventured on a suggestion as a
rule passed it over without the slightest regard.
The word “we” was one seldom heard
from her lips. It was always “my horse,”
“my cow”; she referred to the time when “I
built my barn,” or “when I bought my farm,”
with a complete ignoring of any partner in
the firm matrimonial. Indeed, whatever the
light in which she regarded Elnathan Hagood
personally, for his ability and opinions she
did not disguise her contempt, and any attempt
to assert himself was quickly and vigorously
suppressed; and the common opinion
as to his condition was voiced by an old companion,
“I tell you, she keeps his nose clus to
the grindstun.”</p>

<p>It was then not strange that for the most
part he went about with the subdued and
apologetic air of one aware of his own insignificance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
Sometimes, for his kindly nature
held an especially tender place for children,
he attempted to expostulate in Posey’s
behalf; but his mild, “Now, Almiry, I
wouldn’t,” or “Almiry, you know children
will be children,” made matters no better for
Posey, and only brought a storm about his
own head.</p>

<p>Weakness held no part in Mrs. Hagood;
“capable” was the term that truly fitted her;
at the same time there was no more tenderness
in her nature than in her well-polished
cook-stove. A timid, sensitive child would
have wilted, pined, and perhaps have died
in her atmosphere; but Posey was not more
sensitive than the average healthy, hungry
child, and was even more than usually high-spirited
and fearless. Her affections—meagerly
as they had been fed—were warm,
her impulses generous, and her nature one to
whom love and kindness might have proved
controlling forces where threats and violence
failed. Such being the case, her life with
Mrs. Hagood could hardly fail to intensify all
her faults of temperament; the more so as the
almost daily outraging of her sense of justice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
led to a feeling of resentment that from
its frequency became well-nigh constant.</p>

<p>There were also occasions when this rose
to an especial high-water mark. One such
was the event of a Sunday School picnic to a
little lake distant some half-hour’s ride on
the cars. An event that all the younger
members of the school had looked forward to
with eager anticipations, and Posey perhaps
most of all, for a picnic was something she
had never known. But when the time came
Mrs. Hagood flatly refused her permission to
attend.</p>

<p>“<em>I’m</em> not going to throw away forty cents
to go, and if I wouldn’t for myself I don’t
know why I should for you,” she had said.
“Crystal Lake! I want to know! Nobody
ever thought of calling it anything but Wilson’s
Pond when I was a girl, or of its being
any great sight. But now it’s Crystal Lake
folks must all run to see it, and I don’t suppose
it’s anything more than it was before.”</p>

<p>“Almiry,” ventured Mr. Hagood in his
most persuasive tone, with a glance at
Posey’s drooping head, “ef you’ll let her go
I’ll pay the fare.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“Really, Elnathan Hagood,” turning on
him with withering sarcasm, “seems to me
you have grown suddenly rich. If you have
more money than you know what to do with
you may go over to the store and get me ten
pounds of sugar, and a couple of pounds of
raisins. I want them right away. As for
Posey, I’ve said once she couldn’t go and <em>that</em>
settles it. I don’t believe in picnics, anyway;
they’re just an excuse for people to
spend time and money; Posey hasn’t been
good for anything since they began to talk
of this one, and if she was to go she’d wear
out her shoes, and tear her dress, and come
home so used up she wouldn’t be good for
anything for a week to come. It’s all nonsense,
and she’s enough sight better off right
here.”</p>

<p>So with a swelling heart Posey saw the
others gathering for the start. “Why,
Posey, aren’t you ready?” called one of her
classmates over the fence as she was sweeping
off the walk.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t go,” she answered with the
curtness of despair.</p>

<p>“Won’t Mrs. Hagood let you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>Posey shook her head; it was an occasion
where words were insignificant.</p>

<p>“Well, I just think she’s a horrid, mean
old thing,” cried the indignant and friendly
sympathizer.</p>

<p>“Who’s that is a ‘mean old thing’?” demanded
Mrs. Hagood, who at that moment
suddenly appeared around the corner of the
house.</p>

<p>“No-nobody,” stammered the little girl, all
the more frightened because of her guilty
consciousness.</p>

<p>“Oh,” blandly remarked that lady, “it was
my mistake then; I thought I heard you saying
that somebody was,” and with a grim
smile she turned away, adding as she did so,
“Posey, you have swept that walk long
enough, come in now and wash the dishes.”</p>

<p>It is to be feared that Mrs. Hagood found
Posey anything but efficient help that day,
for the bitter rebellion in her heart found outward
expression in careless, sullen indifference.
She slopped water on the floor, jammed
the wood into the stove, and slammed the
dishes with a violence that threatened their
destruction. And when Mrs. Hagood sharply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
demanded what she was thinking of, she muttered
a reply in a tone that brought her a
shake, with the admonition to be careful, if
she knew what was good for herself.</p>

<p>After the morning’s work was finished
Posey was sent out to pick currants for jelly;
and a little later Mr. Hagood might have
been seen slipping, with all the caution of
a criminal, along behind the screening grapevine
trellis towards the end of the garden
where were the currant bushes, and half hidden
among them Posey shedding hot and bitter
tears over her task.</p>

<p>“I’m real sorry you couldn’t go, Posey,”
he said in a voice lowered as if fearful it
might reach the keen ears of his wife, “for
I know how you’d been a-lottin’ on it; but
Mrs. Hagood knows what’s best fer you.”</p>

<p>Loyalty was a strong element in Elnathan
Hagood’s nature. Whatever his private
thought might be, not a complaining word
of her had he ever been heard to utter. And
child though she was, Posey instinctively recognized
and respected this feeling, but now
carried away by her disappointment and grief
she exclaimed passionately, “I don’t know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
whether she does or not! At any rate I don’t
believe she ever was a little girl in her life.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know the real trouble is,” explained
Mr. Hagood, “that she never had any
little girl of her own.” For it was one of
his favorite theories that a child, especially
a little daughter, would have softened all
the asperity of that somewhat flinty nature,
rendering it at once sweet and tender.</p>

<p>“Besides,” he continued, “a picnic isn’t
anything really so wonderful. I wouldn’t
give a single cent to go to one myself; though
to be sure I’m gettin’ oldish and a bit stiff
for swingin’, and rowin’ on the lake, and
racin’ through the woods, an’ all that sort
of thing I used to enjoy so when I was your
age.”</p>

<p>He checked himself with the sudden realization
that this was hardly the way to impress
upon her what undesirable affairs picnics
were, and busied himself in extracting
a paper parcel from his coat pocket. “Now
don’t cry any more,” he urged; “see here,
I’ve brought you some nuts and candy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Hagood,” cried Posey impulsively
jumping up and throwing her arms around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
his neck, to his great astonishment, and
hardly less confusion, “you are the very best
man in all the world!”</p>

<p>“Well, now, Honey,” his wrinkled face
flushing with pleasure at the caress, to him
something so unwonted and unexpected, and
giving her hand an awkward stroke by way
of return, “you be a good girl and mebby you
and I will go somewhere and have a picnic
by ourselves some day. I’ll see if I can’t
fix it.”</p>

<p>Then Mr. Hagood, in the same stealthy
manner with which he had come, returned to
his shop. And Posey behind the currant
bushes forgot to breathe out threatenings
and slaughter against Mrs. Hagood, as she
munched her candy, so much the sweeter for
the sympathy that had accompanied it, and
found herself more cheered than an hour before
she would have believed it possible she
ever could be again.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE PICNIC</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Elnathan, I’m out of flour; you must go
to mill to-day,” said Mrs. Hagood one morning
a little later.</p>

<p>Mr. Hagood had been anticipating this direction,
but he answered with a guileless air,
“Must you have it to-day? Joe Hatch is a
hurryin’ about his wagon.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can’t bake again till I have some
more flour; and I guess Joe Hatch can wait.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t go?”</p>

<p>“Me? The idea; no, my time’s worth too
much to spend a good share of the day going
to mill. There was a payment due yesterday
on that money I lent Dawson, and if he
doesn’t come this morning I shall go around
and see him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hagood paused in the door with a reflective
manner, “I don’t know, Almira, but
’twould be a good idea to take Posey along
and show her the way; old Jim’s that gentle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
she could drive him well enough, an’ ’twould
be dreadful handy sometimes if I could send
her to mill when I’m pushed with work. She’s
quick to learn anything.”</p>

<p>“Quick enough when she wants to be. But
why don’t you send her to-day? You can
tell her the way; she could hardly miss it.”</p>

<p>“Y-e-s, but it’s kind of ticklish gettin’ down
the hill there at the mill, I’d want to show her
about that myself. But it’s just as you say.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hagood hesitated, but the thought
that if Posey could take his place in going to
mill Mr. Hagood could be at work decided
the matter. “Well, take her then,” she said;
“she’s in the garden picking peas; call her in
and tell her to get ready.”</p>

<p>Just before he was ready to start, Mr. Hagood
came in, “There’s never no knowin’ how
many will be ahead of me, or how long I’ll
have to wait my turn; the last time I got
pretty nigh famished, so I wish you’d put up
a bite o’ lunch in case I have to wait again, as
I’m likely to.”</p>

<p>Then with the bag of wheat in the back of
the stout buggy, the basket of lunch under
the seat, and Rover, the old dog, capering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
around them, they set off, between meadows
where the sun of the July morning had not
yet dried the dewy freshness from the grass,
and cornfields, the ribbon leaves of whose
green rows waved and rustled in the light
breeze. When they were well outside the
village Rover came to the side of the buggy
and looked up with expectant eyes. “Almiry
says there ain’t no sense in lettin’ a dog
ride,” Mr. Hagood remarked apologetically,
“an’ I s’pose she’s right. But Rover does
enjoy it so much that when I’m alone I
generally let him. Come up, old fellow!
There,” as the dog bounded into the buggy,
“sit up now like a gentleman.” And Rover
lifting his head, lolled out his tongue, and
looked first at one and then the other with an
air of deep content.</p>

<p>It was a five-mile drive, but it seemed short
to Posey, though easy-going Jim took his
own gait, and once when Mr. Hagood saw on
a converging road another wagon piled with
bags he held his own horse back until he saw
they had the right of way, which in this case
assured him a wait of two or three hours at
least.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>At last the mill was reached, with the wide,
smooth pond spreading above it, whose water
tumbling over the dam hurried foam-flecked
away through a deep, rocky gorge, made still
more shadowy by the hemlocks that lined it,
on whose very verge stood the tall old mill.
“You think it’s a pretty place?” as Posey
gave a little cry of delight as the shining
water came in view. “Well, I do myself,
for a fact. But look now ef I ever send you
alone,” and Posey watched as he wound down
the short but steep descent to the mill door,
through which she looked with wide, curious
eyes.</p>

<p>“And you never saw a grist mill afore?
Well, come right in an’ see one now,” and
Posey followed Mr. Hagood and the miller
who had shouldered their bag of wheat inside,
where belts and bands were whirring,
and great hoppers slowly turning as they
fed the grain to the crushing stones. The
noise and clatter drowned the miller’s voice
but she understood his good-natured smile
and beckoning finger as he opened little doors
here and there and she caught glimpses of
the wheat on its way to be cleansed from impurities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
of the flour passing through its silken
bolting sieve, of a flowing brown stream of
bran, and a white cataract of swiftly falling
flour: the flour that whitened the miller’s
coat and cap, and lay as a covering over the
floor, and powdered all the beams and ledges
of the mill, and swayed with the wind in
cobweb veils and festoons from the high
rafters. And mingled with all was the
steady, insistent sound of the falling water
just outside, the power that gave force and
motion to it all.</p>

<p>“We’ll have quite a spell to wait,” remarked
Mr. Hagood, motioning Posey to the
door so that his voice could be heard, “there’s
two big grists ahead of us; how’d you
like to go out on the pond? There’s a boat
under the willows at the end of the dam.”</p>

<p>Like it? Of course she would, and in a few
moments she was dipping her fingers in the
clear water as Mr. Hagood rowed the little
boat toward the upper end of the pond where
lily pads were floating on the placid surface
with here and there a blossom opening waxy-white
petals. It was an hour that Posey
never forgot, the soft blue sky above, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
gentle motion of the boat, the lake-like water
that rippled away from the oars, and the lily
blossoms with their golden hearts.</p>

<p>“Well, now, Posey,” said Mr. Hagood, as
they drew in to shore at last, “must be about
noon by the shadders, an’ rowin’s kinder
hungry work, so I guess we may as well have
our lunch.”</p>

<p>For this they chose a spot down close to the
stream below the fall, on a great rock that
jutted out, covered with a green carpet of
softest moss, and shaded by the drooping
hemlocks that found their foothold in the
ledges above. Here Posey spread out the
contents of the well-filled basket, for Mrs.
Hagood’s provision was always an ample one,
the slices of bread and butter, the thin pink
shavings of dried beef, the pickles, the doughnuts
and cookies, while Mr. Hagood added as
his contribution a couple of big golden oranges.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad we had to wait!” observed
Posey as she munched her bread and butter.</p>
<br>

<span class="smcap">It was an hour that Posey never forgot.</span>—<em>Page <a href="#Page_75">75</a>.</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>“This isn’t much of a wait,” answered Mr.
Hagood. “When I was a boy an’ used to
go to mill with my grist in a bag on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>horse behind me, like as not I’d have to wait
till the next day. An’ before that when it
was a hundred miles to the nearest mill father
used to be gone a week at least.”</p>

<p>“I guess he didn’t go very often,” hazarded
Posey.</p>

<p>“Not very, especially as there wasn’t anything
but blazed trees for roads to go by.
In them early pioneer days when folks first
began to come here to Ohio it was a pretty
serious question how to get meal and flour;
sometimes they’d shave it off, an’ sometimes
grind it in a coffee mill. I’ve heard Aunt
Sally Bliss tell that once she nailed the door
of an old tin lantern to a board and grated
corn enough for Johnny-cake for her family;
while quite a few did like my father; he hollowed
out a place in the top of a stump,
worked off a stone till it had a handle for a
pestle, then put the wheat or corn, a little
at a time, in the hollow and pounded it till it
was fine enough to use.”</p>

<p>“That must have been ever so much work.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there was plenty of hard work those
days, but the people had real good times after
all. Sometimes I think better’n we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
now,” he added as he slowly peeled his orange.</p>

<p>“Not any better than to-day,” protested
Posey.</p>

<p>“An’ have you enjoyed it?” a smile brightening
his face, as the miller came to the mill
door and waved his whitened hand in token
that the flour was ready and they rose to
leave, “Has it been like a picnic?”</p>

<p>“A picnic, yes,” a sudden comprehension
coming to her what he had meant it for.
“Dear Mr. Hagood, it’s been so good of you,
and it is the loveliest day I ever had in all
my life.”</p>

<p>So it will be seen that even under Mrs.
Hagood’s rule Posey’s life was not all
shadow, the less so that Mr. Hagood touched
by her pleasure managed with gentle guile
and under one pretext and another to secure
her for a companion now and then. Outings
which it would be hard to tell which enjoyed
the more, Posey for herself or Mr. Hagood for
her. Occasionally, too, some matter of business
would call Mrs. Hagood away for the
afternoon, when she would take her towels
to hem or carpet rags to sew, as the case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
might be, out to the little shop with its mingled
odors of fresh lumber, paint, and varnish,
where Mr. Hagood hummed old tunes
and whistled softly to himself as he worked.
And where seated on a rheumatic buggy seat
in one corner, with the shaggy head of Rover
resting on her knee, in watching Mr. Hagood
at his work, and listening to his favorite old-time
stories she would find real if unexciting
enjoyment.</p>

<p>Then again during the season of raspberries
and blackberries many were the delightful
hours Posey spent berrying in the “back
pasture.” A field this, only a little remote
from the village, but hidden from it by a
bit of intervening woods, and so shut away
from all outward, disturbing sight or sound
that with its peaceful stillness and sunny,
wind-swept solitude, it seemed as genuine
a bit of nature as though the subduing hand
of man had never been laid upon it, and one
which the city-bred child fairly revelled in.</p>

<p>A big, stony, thin-soiled field was the “back
pasture,” affording hardly grass enough for
the two or three cows which fed there, hence
held in slight esteem by its owner and suffered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
to lapse into an almost unchecked
growth of briars and undergrowth, with here
and there a thicket of young and fast-growing
trees, a spot where wild growths ran riot,
where bittersweet hung its clusters, and the
wild grape tangled its strong and leafy
meshes; a spot, too, that the birds knew,
where they nested and sang, for the most part
unmolested and unafraid.</p>

<p>But the crowning charm of the place to
Posey was the chattering brook that with
many a curve and bend, as if seeking excuse
to linger, ran in a little hollow through the
centre of the pasture. A clear, sparkling
little stream, gurgling and hurrying through
the sunlit spaces, loitering in the shadows
of the willows whose green fingers bent down
to meet its current, with shallow places where
one could wade or cross on stepping-stones,
and deep pools where minnows loved to gather
and hide them under the trailing grasses of
the banks.</p>

<p>This was Posey’s first acquaintance with
a brook and for her it had not only charm but
almost personality; she talked to it as she
would to a companion, beside it she felt a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
certain sense of companionship, and no matter
how often she might come, always she
greeted the sight of the stream with the same
delight.</p>

<p>For her these were truly halcyon days, and
most fervently did she wish that berries ripened
the year round. As it was, being both
quick of eyes and nimble of fingers, Mrs. Hagood
permitted her to come nearly as often
as she chose while they were in season. So
many a summer morning was thus spent, for
the best picking was to the earliest comer,
and where it often happened, an addition to
her own content if not to the contents of her
basket, she met other children of the village
bent on a similar errand.</p>

<p>And always whatever of the hard or unpleasant
the days might hold, every week
brought its Sunday, when the interminable
hemming and patch-work and carpet rags,
with the other more distasteful of the week-day
duties were laid aside for one day. Mrs.
Hagood was not herself greatly given to
church-going, but she considered it an eminently
respectable habit and saw to it that
the family credit was duly upheld by Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
Hagood and Posey. In her own mind Posey
held the Sundays when Mrs. Hagood stayed
at home as by far the most enjoyable. For
then Mr. Hagood could pass her surreptitious
stems of caraway seed, with an occasional
peppermint drop; moreover, he could drop
into a gentle doze, and she could venture to
move now and then without fear of a sharp
nudge from Mrs. Hagood’s vigorous elbow.</p>

<p>There, too, was the Sunday School, where
she could sit with a row of other girls, exchange
furtive remarks between the teacher’s
questions, compare library books, or loiter
for little chats on the homeward way.</p>

<p>Then in the long summer Sunday afternoons
she could lie on the grass under the
shading maples and read the same library
books; or perhaps, what was still better, while
Mrs. Hagood dozed in her favorite rocker,
she, Mr. Hagood and Rover, who made the
third in this trio of friends, would stroll
away together, beyond the village, across the
open, sunny, breeze-swept fields, past ripening
grain and meadow, along fence-rows
where alders spread their umbels of lace-like
blossoms, and later the golden rod tossed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
plumes of its yellow-crested army. These
fence-rows that were in very truth the “squirrels’
highway,” on which the sight every now
and then of one skurrying along with bright
eyes and bushy tail saucily waving defiance,
would set Rover nearly wild with excitement,
to the great amusement of his companions.</p>

<p>“Poor old Rover!” was the way Posey
commonly spoke of her dumb friend. But
there was certainly no occasion for the first
adjective, for Mrs. Hagood could truly boast
that nothing around her suffered for the lack
of enough to eat; and as a reward for his
canine faithfulness she even went so far as
to give him a discarded mat on which he
might lie in the woodhouse. But whine he
ever so pitifully, he was not allowed to cross
beyond that threshold and join the family
circle, a privilege his social dog nature did
so crave. And all his tail-wagging and mute
appeals were equally without avail to draw
from his mistress the caressing touch or
word his dog soul so evidently and ardently
longed for.</p>

<p>Rover was a trusty watch-dog, and for this
Mrs. Hagood valued him; at the same time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
she frowned on his idle existence, and had
even considered the matter of having Mr.
Hagood make a dog-power that she might use
him to churn with. Against this her husband
had urged that he wasn’t heavy enough,
though privately he confided to Posey that
it “wasn’t in nature for dogs to work like
humans, an’ he wa’n’t goin’ to make no dog-churn
for old Rover to tread, not if he knew
himself, he wa’n’t.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br>
<span class="fs80">THE STORM BREAKS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The thing, however, which rankled deepest
in Posey’s mind, and caused her more bitter
feelings than everything else, was that for
all Mrs. Hagood’s promise, which she herself
standing by had heard, that Posey should
go regularly to the near-by school, she had
not been allowed to attend even for a
single day. At first she had waited expecting
something would be said about it every
day, and at last had ventured to ask when
she was to begin.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hagood heard the question with an
air of surprise. “School!” she repeated,
“and all the house-cleaning, and spring and
summer work coming on, I wonder how you
think I can spare you to go to school. One
would think that with all I’m doing for you,
and the work you make, that you’d want to
help what little you could.”</p>

<p>Posey choked back a lump in her throat; in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
her own mind she was sure that she was doing
more work than she made, and earning all
she received or she wouldn’t be kept; at the
same time it was plainly evident that school,
at least for the present, was not for her.
“If I can’t go this spring term, can I in the
fall?” she asked somewhat anxiously.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hagood was busy making pies, and
fall was far in the future. “Yes, I guess so,”
she answered, glad to get rid of the matter
so easily. “If you are a smart girl to work
this summer you can go to school next fall.”</p>

<p>So summer went by, and all through its
days Posey bore this promise in mind;
many a time it was an incentive to her when
she would otherwise have flagged; and a
spur to endeavor without which she might
have been negligent. Autumn came, apples
grew ruddy in the orchards, grapes ripened
on the vines, and the woods changed their
summer’s dress of green for one of yellow
and scarlet. Yet Posey, who all through the
spring and early summer had watched with
longing eyes the children passing to and fro,
saw the opening of the fall term draw near—delayed
by repairs on the schoolhouse far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
beyond its usual time—without a single word
or sign as to her going. And the day before
it was to begin Mrs. Hagood said to her,
“Posey, I want you to pick the green tomatoes
to-morrow morning, then after dinner
you can chop them for the mixed pickle.”</p>

<p>Posey’s heart sank with dismay. The ambition
the teacher at the Refuge had awakened,
had grown with her own growth; more still,
an education seemed her one hope of escape
from the life of a charity dependent, and she
determined to risk a great deal rather than
give it up. “Hadn’t I better pick the tomatoes
to-day?” she asked not without an inward
trembling of the heart. “You know
school begins to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hagood paused in the pantry door.
“Well, what if it does?”</p>

<p>“Why, you promised me, don’t you remember?
that I should go to school this fall.”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember, no, and I can’t spare
you to go, anyway. There’s all the pickles
to put up, and apples to dry, and apple butter
to stir, and the pig to be killed, with lard to
try out, and sausage to make, and potatoes
to be sorted over, and Brother Solon’s wife<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
coming for a visit. You don’t much more
than earn your salt now, and to go to school
you wouldn’t be worth anything. All you
care about it anyway is just for an excuse to
race and run and get rid of work.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t, either,” Posey protested hotly,
“I like to study. Ask my teachers at the
Refuge if I didn’t have my lessons. Besides
I want to go to school so I can be a
teacher myself some day.”</p>

<p>“A teacher,” with a scornful laugh that
sent the blood to Posey’s face, “a pretty
teacher you’d make.”</p>

<p>“And when I came here with you,” Posey
went on, sticking to the point in issue, “you
promised that I should go to school.”</p>

<p>“I can teach you all you need. And for a
poor girl who has to depend on charity for
her bringing up, to know how to work is a
great deal more account than a little smattering
of books, and a lot of high-flown,
silly ideas that will never amount to anything.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t mean that I shall go to
school at all?” Posey’s voice trembled a little
as she put the question. She had grown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
pale around the mouth, and her eyes had
become wide and dark.</p>

<p>“I don’t know as it’s any of your business
what I intend,” was the answer in Mrs. Hagood’s
most decided tone. “I’ve told you that
you couldn’t go now, and I don’t want to hear
another word about it.”</p>

<p>Posey laid down the ball of carpet rags
she had been winding and faced Mrs. Hagood,
her slim figure very erect and a spot of
red burning on each cheek. “You are a wicked
woman, and a liar,” she cried shrilly, all
the gathered disappointment and bitterness
of months breaking out in a sudden burst of
fiery passion. “You promised Mr. Mott, at
the Refuge, that I should go to school; I heard
you, and I shall write and tell him just what
you have done.”</p>

<p>“You will, will you?” scoffed Mrs. Hagood.
“And who do you suppose will believe
what you say, a deceiving medium’s child?”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t her child, as you know well
enough,” retorted Posey. “And whatever
she was, she was better than you. She sent
me to school, and didn’t make me work every
enduring minute of the time. And my own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
mother was the most beautiful lady that ever
lived; you are no more like her than you are
like an angel. You are a bad, cruel woman,
that’s what you are.”</p>

<p>Posey had been so repressed with Mrs.
Hagood that when her long smoldering resentment
leaped into wrathful words the latter
stood for a moment in bewildered astonishment.
It was only for a moment, however,
a color so deep it was fairly purple
mottled her face; glancing around her eye
rested on a small wooden rod she had taken
from a curtain, and seizing this she turned
on Posey, “You vile little beggar. I’ll teach
you to talk that way to me!”</p>

<p>With the first blow that fell Posey sprang
forward and fastened her sharp white teeth
in Mrs. Hagood’s hand. But the latter’s
greater strength shook her off before anything
more than a deep mark had been made,
the pain of which, as well as the insult of it
only adding to the storm of blows the hand
rained. “There,” she exclaimed, as breathless
with anger, excitement, and exertion,
she gave Posey a final violent shake, and
whirled her into her little bedroom with such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
force that she fell in a heap on the floor,
“you’ll stay in here till to-morrow morning,
and we’ll see then if you will talk in any such
way, and fly at me like a wildcat. If you do
you’ll get something that you’ll remember as
long as you live, I can tell you.” And with
this parting threat she shut the door with a
bang.</p>

<p>Left alone, throbbing with a rage of resentful
passion, into which the physical pain
entered as a part, Posey threw herself on
the bed and buried her head in the clothes
with the old cry, “Mamma, my mamma,”
and then as a gust of stormy sobs shook her
frame. “Why can’t I die, too, oh, why can’t
I?”</p>

<p>But her tears were not of penitence, far
from it, and it was well that Mrs. Hagood had
not demanded of her any expression of sorrow
for her offense, or of submission for the
future; for in Posey’s present mood she would
have been beaten to death before she would
either have confessed or yielded. As it was
she sobbed as softly as she could, and kept
her face well in the pillow that Mrs. Hagood
might not have the pleasure of knowing that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
she was crying, and under her breath she repeated
over and over, as though it gave her
some relief, “I hate you, oh, I do hate you,
you bad, cruel woman!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br>
<span class="fs80">A DESPERATE RESOLVE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Very soon Posey heard dishes clattering
sharply on the table, for in Mrs. Hagood’s
state of mind she handled even the plates and
cups as though they had been guilty of offense,
and presently the little brass bell rang
out with an energy that warned Mr. Hagood
it would not be wise to linger in obeying its
summons. A moment later and his steps
sounded on the porch, he was wiping his
hands on the towel that hung by the door,
they were sitting down at the table, and
then came his question, “Where’s Posey to-night?”</p>

<p>There was but a thin door between her
room and the kitchen, and Posey had no need
to strain her ears to hear Mrs. Hagood as
with loud and forceful emphasis she poured
forth the story of Posey’s misdoings, to
which the kindly old man who had taken the
friendless child to a tender place in his heart,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
listened sorrowfully. As Mrs. Hagood ended
she also heard his mild tone, “Why, now,
Almiry, I wouldn’t be too hard on Posey; if
she is quick-tempered she’s soon over it, an’
she’s always ready an’ willin’. As for her
bein’ disappointed about not goin’ to school,
she oughtn’t to have did what she did, but I
s’posed you did mean to send her part of
the time; it don’t seem quite right not to, now
really, Almiry, an’ there’s the law, you
know.”</p>

<p>It was a good deal of a protest for Mr.
Hagood to make on any subject—more than he
would have uttered for himself, as Posey well
knew; but the grim silence in which his wife
had listened was only the hush before the
storm which he had drawn on his own head.
“Oh, yes, Elnathan Hagood,” with a biting
sarcasm of tone, “that’s right and just what
I might have expected of you; take up against
your own wife and for a vile, impudent, little
street-beggar. You needn’t think you two
have been so hand in glove all summer without
my seeing it, and this is the upshot, and
you uphold her in it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Almiry!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>“But then I’ve done nothing for you, nothing
at all. I didn’t make you all you are,
and earn for you all you have. I haven’t
worked my fingers off day in and day out for
you. Oh, no; but you don’t owe me anything
for that, certainly not. Only I’d like to know
where you’d be now if it hadn’t been for me,
and where you’d go now if it wasn’t for me,
wanting to give to every missionary and shiftless
creature you can hear of, and to dress
a pauper up in silk and make a lady of her!
One thing I guess, you’d find the poor-house
at the end, and that pretty soon. But then
that’s all the thanks I get.”</p>

<p>“Now, Almiry, you know better,” expostulated
Mr. Hagood.</p>

<p>“But I’ll tell you one thing,” she continued
cutting him short, “it won’t be healthy for
you to be a-settin’ her up against me, and
I’ll see that you don’t have much chance to
do it. And I’ll tell you another thing you
may both depend on, she shall never go to
school now, not a single day. I taught once,
I can teach her, and I’ll begin to-morrow.
And one thing more, as long as I have my
health and strength I don’t propose to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
run over in my own house by any miserable
little upstart, as she’ll find out to her sorrow
if she ever tries it again.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hagood had raised her voice with the
intention that the words should reach Posey’s
ears, who in return shook her small clenched
fist towards the closed door, and was only
restrained from calling out the words which
rose to her lips by the lesson she had recently
and painfully gained, that in a contest
of strength she was no match for Mrs.
Hagood, and was sure to be the sufferer.</p>

<p>Mr. Hagood sighed as he rose from his almost
untasted meal and went out about his
evening chores. And as Posey’s gust of passion
ebbed away she sighed also, not only
for the supper she had been deprived of,
whose savory whiffs had intensified her always
healthy appetite, but from the realization,
of which this going supperless was an
evidence, how mortally she had angered Mrs.
Hagood. For, as she well knew, the battle between
them was not over; instead it was just
begun; that dominant will would not rest till
it had crushed and broken the will which
had dared to oppose it, and Posey aching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
and smarting, but rebellious and unyielding,
lay and looked at the ceiling and felt that it
was indeed a painful way on which she must
enter with the morrow, and in which her
one friend, however innocent, must also suffer.</p>

<p>These gloomy forebodings of the future
grew as the darkness thickened in her little
room; then a slight sound at her window attracted
her attention, and softly raising the
sash she found on the sill outside, a long
row of juicy harvest apples. Tears filled her
eyes, but they were such as she had not shed
before that day, and she kissed the red-cheeked
apples and with a rush of love and
gratitude for the unspoken kindness they expressed.</p>

<p>Poor, hasty, undisciplined Posey! That
she had not been blameless she well knew.
“But Mrs. Hagood was so mean,” so she
justified herself, “or I’d never have done so,
and I don’t believe anybody else would have
stood it either. O dear!” and she sighed very
deeply as she munched an apple, “how I wish
Mr. Hagood and I could go away somewhere
and live all by ourselves; I’m sure with him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
I’d never get angry and ugly, and feel like
fighting.”</p>

<p>For most of all it was love and tenderness
that her lonely little heart longed for, and
having these she thought to be good would
be easy. “Oh, mamma,” was the whispered
plaint that rose to her lips, “if you had only
lived I might have been good, but how can
I now? You told me that God would love
me, but I don’t think He can for nobody else
does.” The wind was rising, and as Posey
leaned against the frame of the still open
window and listened to it rushing and murmuring
through the tall trees around the
house, and watched the dim, shadowy motion
of the waving branches, to her excited fancy
the one seemed to urge, “Come away, come
away,” and the other like inviting hands to
beckon, “Come, come.” And as she looked
and listened an impulse, a sudden resolve
sprang in her heart, and setting her teeth
firmly she murmured as if in answer, “I will
come, I will!”</p>

<p>Posey did not undress when she lay down
again, though first she knelt down by the bed
and repeated her,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Now I lay me down to sleep,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>as usual. But to-night she felt that this was
not enough, that she needed something to
give fuller expression to the tumult of feeling
within her. At the Refuge she had been
taught the Lord’s prayer, but instinctively
she shrank from that clause of forgiveness
of others, for she well knew that the spirit
throbbing so hotly in her heart was anything
but a forgiving one, so for want of something
better she added a petition of her own, “O
Lord, I haven’t anybody in the world, unless
it is you. Take care of me; show me what to
do; help me, please do! Amen.”</p>

<p>It was the first time in her life that Posey
had ever really prayed—all which had gone
before had been a form, a habit. But now in
the hour of her heart-sinking and loneliness,
in the stress of her anger and resentment,
shaken by the mingled impulses of fear and
the courage which comes of desperation, with
no earthly support to lean on, her tumultuous
young soul reached out, feebly it is true, but
still with real longing, for a guidance and
strength higher than her own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>Posey was too excited by all that had happened,
too thrilled with her new, wild determination,
to sleep much or soundly.
Nearly every hour she heard the old clock
in the kitchen strike, and when she counted
three she slipped noiselessly out of bed. Her
room was no longer dark; a great yellow moon
had risen and made it, as well as the outer
world, almost as light as day. Indeed it is
safe to say that but for that flood of softly
illuminating brightness Posey would never
have dared to put her rash impulse to
the test. As it was, her fingers shook as she
gathered together a few articles from her
scanty wardrobe and tied them up in a gingham
apron, not forgetting the few mementos
of her mother which through everything she
had clung to, and were the first to be thought
of now. Then putting on her coarse straw
hat, and wrapping about her an old cape that
chanced to be hanging in the room, she took
her shoes in her hand, cautiously raised the
window, and carefully crept out, something
easily done as it was but a few feet from the
ground.</p>

<p>As Posey stole around the corner of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
house old Rover saw her, and after a brief
sniff came toward her wagging his tail in
friendly recognition. Many a time had she
been comforted by the voiceless sympathy in
the soft eyes of this dumb friend, and now
as she stroked his head, and felt the touch
of his warm tongue on her hand, her sense
of utter desolation was for the moment relieved.</p>

<p>When she reached the pantry window
Posey put down her bundle and stretching
on tiptoe slipped her slender hand between
the slats of the blind, and easily lifted the
latch, and then with the help of a stool on the
back porch quickly crept in. Mr. and Mrs.
Hagood slept quite on the other side of the
house, and moving quietly she had no fear of
being heard by them, while the bright moonlight
gave her light enough.</p>

<p>She had come to the pantry for two reasons:
to make up for the supper she had lost
the night before, and to get supplies for the
enterprise on which she was entering. Nor
did she hesitate to take the best she could
find. “I’ve done enough here to earn it,” was
her reasoning, as she helped herself plentifully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
and without a scruple to the company
cake kept sacredly in a tin box. She appropriated
the cold chicken set aside for the
morning’s breakfast, with a naughty chuckle
at the thought of Mrs. Hagood’s wrath when
she should discover its absence, and she
spread her thick bread and butter with the
best peach preserves that were only brought
out on especial occasions. And having satisfied
her appetite she next packed full a
small-handle basket she found on a shelf, adding
as its crowning delicacy a saucer pumpkin
pie, she by chance discovered.</p>

<p>This done, as she was turning to leave, her
eye fell on a memorandum book with pencil
attached in which Mrs. Hagood kept her egg
account. The sight suggested an idea, and
tearing out a blank leaf she wrote on it as
best she might by the uncertain light, in a
sprawling, childish hand:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Hagood</span>,</p>

<p>“You have been so good to me that I awfully
hate to leave you, and I hope you won’t
blame me for running away, for I couldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
stay any longer, no more at present, good by
with love,</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Posey</span>.”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>With that she climbed out of the window,
closed the blind so that all should be secure
again and tiptoeing around into the woodhouse
laid the folded note on his basket of
kindlings, where Mr. Hagood would find it the
first thing in the morning. This done, she
put on her shoes and hat, took up her bundle
and basket, to go she knew not where; her
one thought that it would be away from Mrs.
Hagood and the renewed contest which the
morning would be sure to bring. As she
moved toward the gate the old dog followed
her with a wistful whine, as if he was puzzled
by and questioned this strange action. “Dear
old Rover,” Posey whispered, throwing her
arms around his neck, while her tears fell
thick on the white star on his forehead,
“dear old doggie, you must go back; I can’t
take you with me. I wish I could and Mr.
Hagood, too, so go back, old fellow, and stay
with him,” and with one last hug she shut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
the gate between them, with a real pain
in her heart; and also shut the gate to the
only place in the wide world that she could
call home.</p>

<p>Already she had thought, “When Mrs. Hagood
misses me she will think I’ve started
back to the Refuge (as I’d like to), and so
I must go just the other way,” and so it was
in this opposite direction that she hurried.
And what a strange world this was into which
she had come, the world of night, of mystery,
of strange quiet, of brooding peace. All the
well-known objects took on a new and unfamiliar
look, as though they had different faces
for the day and the night. In the solemn stillness
sounds unheard by day became strangely
distinct—for the first time she heard the
spring at the foot of the hill falling into its
rocky basin; the cry of a hidden cricket, the
rustle in the wind of the already fallen leaves,
the crow of a rooster in a neighboring barn—sounds
all that in the day she would hardly
have noticed, how loud and eerie they were
now!</p>

<p>In all the village but one light was burning,
in the room of an old man who had been long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
sick and was near death. As Posey saw it
she wondered if when people died they went
out into the night alone, and felt strange and
perhaps afraid. A few hours before she had
almost wished she could die, but now she
shivered a little at the thought as well as the
chill of the night air, and the strange sensation
of being out alone. Yes, she was glad
to be alive, even if there did not seem to be
any place anywhere for her.</p>

<p>Few girls of her age would have dared to
do what she was doing. But Posey was not
timid by nature, and much of her courage
came from the tension of her feverish excitement.
Still, when she had passed through
the village, where all was familiar and there
was a certain sense of companionship in the
clustered houses and the thought of the sleeping
people inside, and leaving the last house
behind, from the hill-top on which she stood,
she saw the open fields and dark woods
stretch away till they melted in dimness, her
heart beat fast and almost failed. For with
the sight a sudden sense of desolation rushed
over her, a realization of how alone and
young, and weak and helpless she was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>For the first time, too, she began to be
troubled by thoughts of the future. She had
heard of runaways who had to sleep nights
in old barns and under haystacks. Boys
from the Refuge had sometimes run away,
and when brought back had told such stories.
Very likely she would have to also, and it
seemed to her that it would be dreadful to
sleep in an old barn, especially if there should
be rats. Besides when her little store of
provision was gone, how would she live unless
she begged? She had often seen ragged
children in the city going from door to door
with baskets, but that was a degradation she
had never known—one her whole nature
shrank from. She would rather starve, she
felt, than to beg at doors, and perhaps be
turned away, as she knew beggars so often
were.</p>

<p>As all these things rose before her Posey
almost wished herself back safe in the little
room she had left. Almost but not quite, for
a memory of Mrs. Hagood’s face as she had
last seen it, and Mrs. Hagood’s voice as it
had last reached her ear stayed her wavering.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
“I won’t go back now, if I die,” she pledged
herself, setting her teeth firmly, and bracing
herself with dogged resolution. “But oh, how
I do wish I could have brought Rover!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
<span class="fs80">A NEW ACQUAINTANCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>That night’s experience was one Posey
never forgot. The road she had chosen she
was now on for the first time; where it led
to she had no idea; all she knew about it was
that it would take her away from Mrs. Hagood,
and in the direction where she thought
there would be least danger of her being
looked for. But once fairly started she hurried
on, her one thought and anxiety to put
all the distance possible between herself and
Horsham before her absence was discovered.</p>

<p>But what it cost her to do this! To her
excited fancy the commonest objects—innocent
stumps, wayside bushes, fence-corner
shadows—took on in the weird light grotesque
shapes that filled her with fear and
trembling. If she had a stretch of lonely
woods to pass through she ran till the beating
of her own heart fairly startled her.
Was she out of sight of houses, she would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
quicken her steps and almost fly. When a
house came in sight she walked more slowly;
to be near people, even if they knew nothing
of her, was something, and the barking of a
dog was always a welcome sound. When she
heard it she knew there was something living
and awake, which lessened a little her
feeling that she was a sort of wandering
spirit, driven on and on in a dim world where,
save for the uncanny night birds, nothing
was astir but herself. Yes, Posey was
afraid, at times desperately afraid, but she
felt that every step was taking her farther
from Mrs. Hagood, and for the sake of that
she was willing both to dare much and to endure
much.</p>

<p>By and by, however, signs of the coming
morning began to appear. First a faint line
of light along the eastern sky, then lights
were seen gleaming here and there in farmhouse
windows, and curls of smoke rising
from chimneys, in token that the world was
rousing to the new day; once across the fields
she heard a loud hearty voice calling, “Coo-boss,
coo-boss,” to the cows in some out-of-sight
pasture, and again she caught a distant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
glimpse of some boys with bags on their shoulders,
evidently off for an early nutting expedition.
Gradually these signs of life multiplied,
the clouds grew more rosy, the trees,
no longer vague, dark masses, showed their
brilliant hues of red and gold; wayside objects
lost their dim and spectral look; all the
world was waking into the crisp brightness
of a clear, fresh, autumn morning, sweet with
the fruity smell of ripened orchards, and rich
with the soft mellowness of the long summer
time.</p>

<p>With everything around her new and
strange Posey had no idea how far she had
come. This she did know, that the bundle
and basket she carried were all the time
growing heavier, that her aching feet dragged
more and more slowly, and that she was so
tired she could go only a little way without
stopping to rest.</p>

<p>The sun was now well up, and as Posey
paused she looked around the unfamiliar
landscape. What she saw was a stretch of
level, low-lying fields which merged into a
wooded swamp—a thick tangle of trees and
bushes whose dark line spread out as far as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
her eye could follow. Beyond the swamp,
and at no great distance, rose a steep range
of wooded hills; solid masses of gayly tinted
colors they appeared that morning, following
with gentle curves the windings of the
swamp; and crowning the highest of these
hills, rising above the trees, lifted the white
spire of a church, its gilted weather-vane glittering
in the sun. Before her the white road
lifted in a long upward swell that made her
sigh with the thought of climbing it, and shut
in her view to the flat around. But one house
was near—a tall gaunt house of weather-beaten
red, standing on a slight knoll a little
back from the road, with a single tree, a tall
and sombre pine, beside it, and all the green
paper curtains that shaded its front windows
drawn closely down. A dreary house
it was in Posey’s eyes, and the people who
lived in it she thought must grow so tired of
looking out on those flat pastures, tufted with
hillocks of coarse, marshy grass, and the
swamp with its bordering fringe of dead,
grey bushes.</p>

<p>But it may be that to her eyes the fairest
view would have taken on something of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
desolate mood. In the sand that now made
the road, her steps dragged heavier and more
slowly, but save for brief pauses to rest she
dared not stop. She was not far enough
away. Oh, no, not yet. Mrs. Hagood might
be hunting her even then, was the thought
hurrying her on. She was hungry, too, with
the crisp air, and her exertion, for all the
hearty lunch she had taken at starting; but
she was afraid to make any inroad on the
contents of her basket, for when once that
was gone she had no idea how or where she
would get anything more. It would be dreadful
to keep feeling so faint and hungry, and
was there anybody anywhere, she wondered,
who would pity her enough to give her something
to eat, or take her in when it came night
again? Or would she have to go on and on,
till she fell down somewhere and died? And
a slow trickle of tears ran down her cheeks
at the foreboding. This was a hard world,
she bitterly felt, for girls who had no homes.
If God was good why didn’t He make homes,
real homes, for all of them? She was sure
she would if she were God, and especially
one for poor Posey Sharpe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>A little stream, its course marked by fringing
reeds and rushes, wound its way through
the fields and crossed the road a little way
before her, spanned there by a wooden
bridge with high, close sides, overhung at
each end by clumps of willows which formed
a thick green screen. Slowly and wearily
Posey stumbled up the slight ascent leading
to the bridge; she had taken but a few steps
when a loose board rattled under her tread,
and a moment later she started with a little
cry as the face of a boy suddenly appeared
around a side at the farther end.</p>

<p>His eyes also grew wide with surprise, and
it was no wonder, for a strange little figure it
was which met his gaze. Her shoes were
white with dust, her hat was jammed to one
side, her cape was all askew, her gingham
bundle hung limply from one arm, and in the
other hand was the basket, from which she
had lost her handkerchief that at first had
covered it. This basket with the saucer
pumpkin pie on top, was what first caught
the boy’s notice, and he called out in a half
bargaining, half jesting tone, “Any extra
pies you want to trade for tinware this morning?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
Then as he saw the tear-stains on
her cheeks, into which the dust had settled
in grimy streaks, and her swollen, overflowing
eyes, he quickly swung himself around
onto the bridge, asking, “What is it; what’s
the matter?”</p>

<p>Now notice was of all things what Posey
most dreaded, and as the morning was still
early few people were yet stirring, so till
now she had not attracted attention. For
one thing she had been careful not to do so;
since daylight she had crept carefully by the
few houses she had passed, as much in the
shadow of the fences as possible; and once
when she saw a wagon coming, with people
and trunks, as if for some railroad station,
she had hidden behind a clump of bushes till
they were gone by. For her great fear was
that some one would send word to Mrs. Hagood,
or even return her by force, and every
hour but added to her fierce determination
never to go back—never!</p>

<p>Of course she knew that she would be seen
and questioned. “And I must have something
ready to say,” had been her thought.
“Yes, I know, when any one asks me where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
I am going, I shall tell them that my Aunt
Mary is sick and has sent for me. I know
it’s a lie, and I hate liars, but I can’t tell the
truth, and if I had an Aunt Mary and she was
sick I’m sure she’d send for me,” and with
this she had salved her conscience. But now
as she heard the friendly tone, and looked
into the frank boyish face, with honest, merry
blue eyes, and a kindly expression under the
sunburn and freckles, she forgot all her prudent
plans in a longing for the sympathy that
spoke in his tone, and lifting her eyes to his
she answered simply, “I’m running away.”</p>

<p>He gave a slight whistle of surprise, “Running
away? What are you doing that for?”</p>

<p>By this time Posey had come close to him,
and putting her bundle and basket down on
the abutting stone work of the bridge, she
rolled up her sleeve and showed her arm,
across which ran a number of angry red
welts. “And they’re worse here,” she said,
putting her hand up to her shoulders.</p>

<p>“My!” he exclaimed, his tone full of mingled
sympathy and indignation. “Whatever
did you do that your mother whipped you
like that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>“She wasn’t my mother,” was the vehement
reply, all Posey’s sense of outraged suffering
breaking out afresh. “She was only
the woman who took me from the Refuge in
Cleveland; she made me work from morning
till night, and scolded me the whole time;
she was the crossest woman you ever saw,
and she wouldn’t let me go to school after
she had promised at the Refuge that I should.
And she was mad and whipped me that way
because I told her that she was a mean,
wicked liar, just as she was.” Her eyes
flashed with the remembrance.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you anybody of your own?” he
asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head. “My mother and
father both died when I was a little bit of a
girl.” Then with a piteous little cry, “I don’t
see why my mother couldn’t have lived or I
have died, too!” and overcome with a mingling
of weariness, nervous excitement, and
emotion, Posey dropped down beside her bundle,
and hiding her face in it burst into a
passion of sobs.</p>

<p>“There, there,” and as he spoke there was
a shake in his own voice, and a moisture in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
his own eyes. “Don’t cry so, don’t. I’m
awfully sorry for you. I’ve lost my father
and mother, too, and I know how tough it is
on a fellow, though Uncle John and everybody
have been good to me.”</p>

<p>By this time Posey had succeeded in checking
her sobs, and in answer to his questions
she poured out her whole story, ending with
her flight. “You’re a regular brick,” he exclaimed
with boyish enthusiasm as she finished,
“to start off that way, alone in the
night. I’d like to see my cousin Emma or
Fannie doing anything of that sort, and they
both bigger than you are; but my, they hardly
dare to look out of doors alone after it comes
dark! Won’t I have something to tell them,
though, when I go home? And I don’t blame
you for running away, either, though to be
sure,” he added impartially, “it might have
been better if you had kept out of a row.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it would,” Posey admitted meekly.</p>

<p>“But now that you have done it,” he asked
in a practical tone, and with a business-like
clearness, “what are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” answered Posey, realizing
suddenly and with confusion, how very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
vague her ideas were, and what a wild undertaking
hers was. “I didn’t know—I
thought—I hoped—that I might find somebody—somewhere,
who would let me live with
them. I can wash dishes, and iron, and
sweep, and churn, and bake apple pies and
ginger-cake—Mrs. Hagood taught me—and
do lots of things about the house,” sadly feeling
that her list was after all but a short one.
“I would try <em>so</em> hard to suit. Don’t you
think I could find such a place?” and she
looked in his face appealingly.</p>

<p>“I should think so,” he answered after a
moment’s pause. For with all his boyishness
there was about him a certain thoughtfulness
and readiness of decision, which led
Posey to regard him with an instinctive trust
and reliance. “At any rate,” he added,
“you might try; I don’t think of anything
better just now that you could do.”</p>

<p>All this time there had been a frequent
splashing and stamping down below them in
the creek, and several times the boy had
looked over the side of the bridge to call,
“Whoa, there, whoa,” or “Stand steady,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
Billy.” “Let’s see,” he went on, “you’re
about eight miles from Horsham now,—you
must have clipped it pretty lively, but you
look awful tuckered, and I don’t believe you
could make another eight miles.”</p>

<p>“I—I’m afraid not,” Posey sadly agreed,
for having once stopped it seemed to her that
she never could start on again.</p>

<p>“And as you’re running away I suppose
you want to get as far away as you can?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, I do.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I guess I will give you a lift.
Of course you don’t know me, but my name’s
Ben Pancost, and I’m a tin peddler,” the last
with an air of business-like pride.</p>

<p>“You don’t look old enough to be a tin peddler,”
was Posey’s comment. “All I ever
saw were old men with hook noses.”</p>

<p>“I was fifteen last March. I guess Mr.
Bruce thinks that will do, at any rate I’ve
been on one of his wagons all summer. I
stayed last night at that house,” indicating
by a jerk of his thumb the red house on the
knoll, “and this morning one of the wagon
tires seemed loose, so I drove into the creek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
to let Billy drink, and swell up the wheel.
You saw my red cart as you came along,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“No; the willows must have hid it. I
didn’t know that there was anybody anywhere
near, that was why I was scared when
you looked around the corner of the bridge.
And, oh, it’s so good of you to let me ride!”</p>

<p>But Ben had a boy’s horror of thanks. “I
guess by this time the wheel is soaked,” he
hastened to say, “so I’ll drive out of the
creek and then this train will be ready to
pull out.”</p>

<p>An hour before Posey would hardly have
believed that she could ever again feel like
laughing. But there was something so infectious
in the cheery good humor, the ready
self-confidence, and above all the hearty sympathy
of her new friend, that she laughed
gayly at his merry tone and twinkling eyes,
as, swinging around the corner of the bridge,
he jumped down, and soon the stout bay
horse and red cart came into view at the opposite
end of the bridge—such a cart as she
had more than once seen that summer, with
great sacks of rags piled high on its top, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
a fringe of old rubber boots dangling around
the bottom.</p>

<p>While Ben was making sure that everything
was in good order and securely fastened
before he started, Posey ran down to
the clear water and wetting her handkerchief
washed her face and hands, straightened
her hat and cape, and made herself look
as tidy as she could. Her spirits had even
risen so high that sitting down on the grassy
bank she ventured into her lunch, and fancying
that she saw Ben give another glance at
the pie, as a slight expression of her overflowing
gratitude she held it out to him, urging,
“Do take it. I know it’s good, for Mrs.
Hagood always makes such nice pumpkin
pies.”</p>

<p>Ben looked at the tempting delicacy with a
true boy’s appetite. “I’ll tell you what I
will do,” drawing out his pocketknife, “I’ll
cut it in two and eat one half if you will the
other. No, I sha’n’t take the whole of it.
Besides, I’ve read of people breaking bread
together as a pledge of friendship; well, we’ll
break this pie together as our pledge.”</p>

<p>“You see,” he continued as he wiped away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
the last flaky crumb, “the potatoes this
morning were warmed over, the pork was
warmed over, the coffee was warmed over,
and it was a sort of a warmed-over breakfast
generally. But then I oughtn’t to complain,
for Billy and I had our lodging and
breakfast, and I only had to give a tin dipper,
a quart basin, and two pie tins for it all.
That’s why I stop at houses instead of hotels
when I can, the women, mostly, will take tinware
for pay, and as there’s a profit on it,
why, that makes my expenses that much the
less for Mr. Bruce.”</p>

<p>As he helped Posey to the high seat, and
mounting beside her gathered up the lines
and chirruped to the horse, she gave a start.
“Why, you are going back the way I came.”</p>

<p>“Only a little way. The road bends so
you didn’t notice where the one you were on
came into this, but I’ll show you the place;
Horsham is south, and I’m going west; then
after a little I shall turn north, for I’ve quite
a circuit to make to-day.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br>
<span class="fs80">TWO HAPPY TRAVELERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>How wonderfully the face of all the outer
world changes with our feelings.</p>

<p>It was so with Posey. As her heart grew
light she began to feel the brightness and
charm of the sunny October morning, a late
lingering robin whose note when she first
heard it a little while before she had thought
sad and sorrowful, now had a cheery sound;
and the call of a flock of blackbirds flying
over she thought most musical.</p>

<p>Even the swamp, which had looked to her
so dismal, as she rode through it was transformed
and became full of delights. Its
thick crowding bushes gleamed with coral-hued
berries, its tangled depths were rich
with every tone of tint or color, and through
the centre a little river, set thick with lily pads,
loitered along with the laziest possible
current. Not a few of the trees and shrubs
which bordered the narrow roadway, made,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
as Ben explained, by filling in earth through
the swamp—were draped with festoons of
wild clematis vines in their autumn beauty,
set with fluffy masses of filmy, smoke-hued
fringe. From her high seat Posey reached
out and pulled lengths of this, which she
twined about the dashboard, exclaiming with
delight at its delicate beauty. A few wild
roses were still in blossom on the thickets,
whose gleaming red hips hinted at a wealth
of earlier bloom, and here and there the scarlet
leaves of the poison ivy added their vivid
hue to the wealth of color.</p>

<p>For part of the way the trees beside the
roadway met overhead, forming an arch, now
more of gold than green, through which the
golden sunshine filtered and flickered in delicious
coolness. Once or twice the narrow
road widened into a grassy space; “Turning-out
places,” Ben explained, for teams to pass
each other. Which set Posey to wondering
what people would do if they met in any
other than the right spot.</p>

<p>“But they <em>have</em> to meet there,” Ben asserted.
“When one person sees another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
coming he stops and waits. There’s no trouble
when everybody looks out.”</p>

<p>But what was to Posey the crowning charm
was a wide drainage ditch or canal, near the
outer edge of the swamp, the cause of the
fringe of dead bushes she had already noticed.
Ben stopped his horse on the bridge
that crossed it, that at their leisure they
might look up the long, straight stretch of
water, whose clean-cut banks of velvety turf
narrowed in perspective till they seemed at
last to meet in the level distance, while on its
still surface, trees, shrubs, clumps of nodding
blue asters, and the sky, bluer than all, were
reflected as in a mirror.</p>

<p>“Oh, how lovely!” cried Posey. “I never
saw so pretty a place in all my life. I wish
we could ride through it all day.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is pretty,” answered practical
Ben, “but it’s not good for much as it is now.
I suppose, though, it will all be dry land
some day; that’s what the man said where I
stayed all night, and this big ditch is to help.
He thought some time it would all be dry
land.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>“At any rate, I’m glad to have seen it as
it is now,” declared Posey.</p>

<p>For Posey had yielded herself to the gladness
of the day, and in after years it stood
apart in her memory. There was the delicious
sense of freedom as of a bird escaped
from its cage, with that of triumph as the
distance widened between her and her late
bondage; and in addition the blissful reaction
from anxiety, the rest after fatigue, the happiness
in her new-found friend, and of trusting
confidence in his protecting care and superior
knowledge. She had shaken off the
past, the future was an unknown quantity,
the happy present was enough.</p>

<p>For to Posey, whose life had held such a
scanty store of pleasure, one continued delight
was that long ride in the soft, warm,
October sunshine. Through quiet country
roads they wound, among fields green with
aftermath, and hills rich with October woods.
Sometimes these were so near that she could
see the ripe leaves dropping softly down like
a golden rain, and again distant with all their
varied hues of gold and scarlet and crimson
and russet blended by the misty autumn haze;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
but whether near or far always a splendor
of color. The cornfields along the way were
dotted with great sheaves of the harvested
corn, among which the orange spheres of the
pumpkins lay thick, and where the huskers
were busy stripping the husks from the yellow
ears that overflowed baskets and heaped
wagons.</p>

<p>Orchards, too, there were, fruity with scent
of the red-cheeked apples which loaded the
trees. Occasionally they met loads of apples
on the way to be made into cider. Once
they passed a cider mill by the roadside, and
stopped for a drink of the sweet juice as it
came fresh from the press. At another time
they drove under a tree overgrown by a wild
grapevine, and Ben, standing on the seat,
had gathered his hands full of the little, spicy-flavored,
frost grapes. While scattered
along the way were clumps of woodbine, its
leaves flushed russet crimson; bittersweet
with its clustered orange berries beginning
to show their scarlet hearts; with lingering
sprays of golden rod, and lavender drifts of
the wild aster. The farmhouses at which
Ben stopped to trade—for he was too faithful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
an employee to forget his business for
any pleasure—had for the most part, it
seemed to Posey, a cozy, homelike air, the
yards of many gay with fall flowers that the
frosts had not yet killed.</p>

<p>And how their tongues did run! Ben Pancost
had to hear in its fullest detail Posey’s
whole story, with especial interest in that
part of her life with Madam Atheldena
Sharpe.</p>

<p>“How many different cities you have
seen!” he exclaimed once with an accent of
almost envy.</p>

<p>“No, I never saw very much of them after
all. You see, we always lived in a crowded
part, so one was a good deal like another.”</p>

<p>“And how did you use to feel when you
were pretending to be a spirit?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sometimes I thought it was sort of
fun. One day, I remember, at school the
teacher had us put our hands up and up as
we sang, higher and higher, like this,” and
she raised her arms in a gently undulating
motion. “That evening I did it again as I
came out, and the people at the <em>séance</em> all
held their breath and whispered, ‘Oh, how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
beautiful!’ You ought to have heard them,”
and Posey laughed as she recalled the incident.
“Yes, sometimes it was no end of fun,
but most times I was tired and sleepy and it
was <em>so</em> tiresome. The changing dresses, and
wigs, and all that, and I used to think how
stupid the folks were not to know that it was
only me.”</p>

<p>“And were you frightened when they
found you out?”</p>

<p>“Frightened? Well, I guess I was! I
knew the Madam would be in a rage, and I
didn’t know what they would do to me, either.
They tore my wig off, and crowded round
me, and everybody was talking at once, but I
pulled away, somehow, and ran. My, how
I did run; ’way up into the attic! I’d never
been there before, but it was some place to
hide, and it wasn’t so bad, for I stumbled
onto an old mattress, only I was afraid there
might be rats. But I wasn’t as afraid of the
rats as I was of the people downstairs, and
by and by, when it was all still, I went to
sleep. Then in the morning when I waked
up and went down the Madam was gone.
She knew that I had no other place in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
world to go to; but she never did care for
anybody but herself. I tell you, it was awful
to be turned out so, and not know what
to do. I felt almost as bad as when you saw
me this morning.”</p>

<p>“It was a shame,” Ben agreed heartily.
“But then she couldn’t have been a very good
woman, anyway. And don’t you think it was
just as wrong as lying to deceive people so?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it was,” Posey admitted simply.
“My mamma always told me never to
tell lies, and I don’t mean to; but I began to
‘manifest,’ as she always called it, when I
was so little that I didn’t think anything
about its being right or wrong. I should
have had to done it whether I wanted to or
not, for when Madam was cross I tell you I
had to stand round. Besides, that was the
way we made our living, and in the city folks
have to have money to live. Here in the
country you don’t know anything about it.
Look at the apples in that orchard. I used
to go to the market for Madam and buy a
quart of apples. Just six or seven, you
know. Sometimes I could get a market-woman
to put on one more, and then I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
that to eat for myself. And milk! Why,
we never bought more than a pint at a time,
more often half a pint; and a half a pound
or a pound of butter. You don’t know how
strange it did seem to go out and pick things
off as they grew, and to see so much of everything.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t want to live that way,” admitted
Ben.</p>

<p>“I guess not. Sometimes I felt so much
older than the other girls of my age at Horsham.
They had fathers and mothers who
bought them everything. They never
thought about the cost, and they all had
spending money—not a great deal, but some—to
use as they pleased. And I—why I can
hardly remember when I didn’t have to think
about the price of everything. When Madam
gave me money to go out and buy things she
used to say, ‘Now see how far you can make
this go.’ She was always telling me how
much my shoes and clothes and what I ate
cost. And as for ever having any money to
spend for my very own self, why I wouldn’t
know what that was.” She paused and an
accent of bitterness crept into her next words:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
“You may say what you please, but I believe
God cares a lot more for some folks than He
does for others. He gives them such a sight
more. At any rate, I’m ‘most certain He
doesn’t care anything for me,” and she gave
the red dashboard a little kick by way of emphasis.</p>

<p>“Why, Posey!” Ben cried in astonishment,
“God cares for everybody!”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” protested Posey fiercely,
“why did He make my mother die, and why
doesn’t He give me a home somewhere?”</p>

<p>Ben looked puzzled for a moment, then he
brightened. “Did you ever ask Him to take
care of you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did last night. I asked Him to
help me, and take care of me. And where
would I be now if it wasn’t for you?”</p>

<p>“Why, Posey!” cried Ben triumphantly.
“Don’t you see that He sent me?”</p>

<p>“Do you think He did?” A sudden seriousness
had come into Posey’s face.</p>

<p>“Of course. I know it. Why, once when
I was a little boy I had a bow and arrow.
One day I shot my arrow away so far I
couldn’t find it, though I hunted and hunted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
Finally I knelt right down in the grass and
asked God to help me find my arrow; and do
you believe me, when I opened my eyes the
first thing I saw was my arrow, only a little
way from me. Perhaps if you had asked
God to help you before he would have done
so.”</p>

<p>“But,” persisted Posey, “sometimes it
doesn’t help people any when they do pray.
There was a woman in Horsham whose
daughter was sick this summer, and she had
folks come and pray for her to get well, but
she died all the same.”</p>

<p>As she was speaking Ben drew out a handsome
pocketknife. “Isn’t that knife a
dandy?” he asked, holding it out in his hand.
“Five blades, all the very best steel, and the
handle inlaid. When I was seven years old
my Uncle Ben, in Nebraska, that I was named
for, sent it to me. Father said I was too little
to have such a knife then, that I would be
apt to break it, and to cut me with it, so he
laid it away till I was older. Well, I wanted
it then, and I used to tease and tease father
for it, and almost think it was unkind and
mean in him to keep my own knife away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
from me. The day I was ten years old he
said:</p>

<p>“‘Ben, here is your knife. If I had given
it to you at the first, as you wanted me to,
very likely it would by this time be broken
or lost, and you might have been badly hurt
with it. Now you are old enough to value
and use it carefully. And when you look at
it remember this, my boy, that God often has
to do by us as I have by you—refuse us the
thing we ask for because it might hurt us, or
because the time has not yet come when we
are ready for it. Refuses us simply because
He loves us.’”</p>

<p>“Why, Ben!” exclaimed Posey with wide-open
eyes, “I never heard anything like that
before. And you talk just like a minister.”</p>

<p>“I’m only telling you what my father said.
Perhaps because he died so soon afterwards
is one reason I’ve always remembered it.
And he was good as any minister. I don’t
believe there ever was a better father,” and
there was a tremble in Ben’s voice.</p>

<p>“Tell me about yourself now; I’ve told
you all about myself,” urged Posey.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br>
<span class="fs80">BEN’S STORY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“I haven’t much of anything to tell,” Ben
answered slowly. “You see, I always lived
in the country, and in just one place till
father and mother died four years ago. But,
oh, it was so pleasant there! Back of the
house was the orchard, and beyond that a
long hill where we went coasting in the winter,
Theodore and I—he’s my brother three
years older. At the foot of the hill was a
little creek where we used to go fishing in
spring. The fish were mostly suckers. I
suppose some folks wouldn’t have cooked
’em; but then mothers will do ’most anything
for boys; at any rate, such a mother as
ours would, and my, but they did taste good!
We used to skate on the creek, too, in the
winter. But you’ve never been in the country
in the winter; you don’t know what fun it
is: sliding down hill, sleighriding, and snowballing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
all such fun,” and Ben’s eyes sparkled
as he named them.</p>

<p>“The house, too, was so cozy. A red house
with a trumpet-vine growing over it, and a
long porch in front. I always like to see a
red house because it makes me think of home.
And out in the orchard there were strawberry
apples, and seek-no-furthers, and nonesuches.
A big grapevine ran all along the
woodhouse. There was a black-walnut tree
in the back yard, some chestnut trees in the
pasture, beside hickory trees in the north
woods. And didn’t we go nutting in the fall,
just didn’t we! Whole bags of nuts to crack
in the winter evenings and eat with apples,
though the getting ’em is better than the eating,
after all.</p>

<p>“On the edge of the creek was the sugar
bush, and in the spring we used to help father
gather the maple sap from the trees and boil
it down in the old sugar house. It was hard
work, but there was fun with it—the sugaring
off, and making wax on the snow, and stirring
the warm sugar. I tell you I feel awful
sorry for boys who have never lived in the
country and had any of the good times. Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
course we went to school, not quite a mile
over the hill, and Sundays we went three
miles to church.</p>

<p>“And best of all were father and mother!
I couldn’t begin to tell you how good they
were. Mother used to tell us stories, and
help us make balls and kites; and father
would take us with him, and let us follow him
about the farm, when I suppose we hindered
a good deal more than we helped. He was
always ready to answer our questions, too,
and to help us with a hard lesson, and he used
to give us calves and lambs for our very own.
I don’t believe there ever was a father and
mother did more to make two boys happy,”
and Ben drew a tremulous sigh.</p>

<p>“Mother was always delicate,” he went on
after a moment’s pause, “and father and we
boys used to do all we could to help her. But
one fall she took a hard cold—none of us
once thought of it being anything more than
a cold. All winter she coughed so hard, and
nothing the doctor gave her did any good.
Theodore and I used to say to each other,
‘When it comes spring then mother will be
well again,’ and we were so glad of the warm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
days, for they would make mother better.
She didn’t get better, though; she kept growing
weaker and weaker, and the children at
school began to ask me did I know my mother
was going to die? It made me so angry to
have them say such things; and sometimes
I would wake up in the night and find Theodore
crying, for he is older, you know, and
realized more what was coming. Then I
would put my arms around his neck and say,
‘Don’t cry, Theodore; of course mother will
get well. Why, we can’t live without her!’</p>

<p>“So it went on till September, and by that
time she could only walk around the house
a little, and had to lie on the sitting-room
lounge most of the time; but so sweet and patient,
there was never any one like her, I’m
sure. Father used to come in from his work
every little while and sit beside her, and when
he went out I would see the tears in his eyes,
for I suppose it was hardest of all for him. In
September the men came with the thrashing-machine
to thrash the wheat and oats. It
was a chilly day for that time of the year, with
one of those raw, sharp winds that cuts right
through you. The dust of the thrashing always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
made father about sick, and with that
and the weather he took a sudden cold that
settled on his lungs. That night he was so
sick Theodore had to go for the doctor, and,
Posey, he only lived three days.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t believe it. He had always been
so strong and well that I had never thought
of his dying. I knew the doctor thought he
was very sick, and we were all frightened,
but I didn’t once think he was going to die.
And when he called us to him to bid us good-by,
and told us to do all we could for mother,
and to be good boys and good men, and live
so that we should be ready for God’s call
when it came for us—I didn’t believe it even
then—I didn’t believe it till he was—gone.”</p>

<p>Ben’s voice had grown husky, and he
stopped for a little before he could go on.
“For about two weeks after that mother
kept about as she had been, and what with
the shock and excitement even seemed a little
stronger. But one night we had to help
her into her room and the next morning she
said she felt so weak she wouldn’t try to get
up. And she never left her room again. She
failed so fast it seemed as though we could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
just see her slipping away from us; and she
was so happy to go, except as she was sorry
to leave us boys. She told us how we had
better manage, and what she wanted us to
do and be; and I don’t believe either Theodore
or I will ever forget what she said to
us or the promises we made to her.</p>

<p>“When father died it was hard enough,
though there was mother left. But when she
went, only three weeks after him, I tell you
it was awful. I never shall forget as long
as I live the evening after mother’s funeral.
You see, father had only one brother, Uncle
Ben, out in Nebraska, so of course he
couldn’t come. Uncle John, mother’s only
brother, lived fifty miles away, and George,
his boy, was sick with a fever, so he had to
go right back; that left us all alone with
Matty, the girl. And after we had looked
after the chores and went in and sat down
everything was so strange and empty and
lonesome, I never shall forget it.</p>

<p>“Every night since we could remember
father, or mother if he was away, had read a
chapter in the Bible and had prayers. After
father died Theodore had read the chapter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
and mother had prayed, if it was only a word
or two, till the very last night she lived. She
had said she hoped we would try and do as
near as we could as we always had when she
and father were with us, so Theodore thought
we’d better have prayers; that they’d want
us to. He read the chapter—I don’t see how
he did it—and said he thought we could say
the Lord’s prayer, anyway, and we kneeled
down and began. But all at once it came
over us like a great wave how everything
was changed and always would be, and it
broke us all up so we couldn’t go through
with it.” And Ben’s voice choked and failed
him at the recollection, while unchecked tears
of sympathy ran down Posey’s cheeks.</p>

<p>“When Uncle John went away he told us to
do the best we could and as soon as George
was better and he could leave home he would
come and help us settle everything up. There
wasn’t so very much to do beside the everyday
work except to gather the apples and
harvest the corn. We had a big field of corn
that year, but we managed to get it cut up and
began to husk it. But it was slow work, for
I was only a little shaver—not quite eleven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
years old, and Theodore isn’t strong like I
am. It came on cold early that fall and we
got pretty discouraged. One night there was
a circle round the moon, and Theodore said
he was afraid we were goin’ to have a snowstorm.
That would make the husking harder,
and we both felt real worried. But what do
you think? When we went out in the field
the next morning the corn was all husked and
in heaps ready to draw in! It had been a
moonlight night and the neighbors had all
turned in and done it for us. They were all
so good to us I shall never forget it of them.</p>

<p>“As soon as he could Uncle John came
back, and then we sold the farm. We hated
to, but he thought that was best, for though
it was only a small one we were too young
to manage it. When everything was settled
there was eight hundred dollars apiece for
Theodore and me. Uncle John put this out
at interest for us, secured by mortgage so it
should be safe, and took us home with him.
But Uncle John isn’t rich by any means, and
he has five children of his own, so though they
are all kind as can be we didn’t want to live
on him. For two years now, I’ve been driving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
this tin-cart summers. I get twenty dollars
a month and my expenses, and I’ve a
hundred dollars in the bank I earned myself.
Winters I live at Uncle John’s and go to
school. He won’t take anything for my
board, but I buy dresses and things for Aunt
Eunice and my cousins; they are so good to
me I want to do what I can for them. With
what I earn and the interest on my own
money, as soon as I’m old enough I mean to
buy a farm. I would like a store, but Uncle
John thinks a farm is safer, and perhaps I’ll
buy the old farm back.”</p>

<p>“How nice that would be!” cried Posey.</p>

<p>“Why, see here, Posey,” with the force of
a sudden idea, “when I get a farm I shall
need somebody to keep the house, and I’ll tell
you what I’ll do, I’ll marry you. Then you
can have a home, too; we’re both orphans
and haven’t either of us one now.”</p>

<p>Posey clapped her hands. “That will be
splendid! I know I should just love to live
on a farm, and I will learn to make butter,
and do all the things they do on farms. But,”
and her face sobered, “won’t your brother
want to live with you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>“No; Theodore doesn’t take to farming.
He’s teaching now, a summer school up in
Michigan. His plan is to go to college and
then be a minister. He’ll make a tiptop one,
too.”</p>

<p>“I think you ought to be a minister,” said
Posey. “You talk good enough for one.”</p>

<p>“Me? Shucks,” and Ben gave a long
whistle. “I ain’t good enough for a minister.
Besides, I never could talk before folks
as Theodore can. I wish you could hear him
lead the Endeavor meeting. I tried to once,
and my, I was so scared I didn’t know
whether I was afoot or horseback.”</p>

<p>Posey’s eyes had grown wide. “Why, I
thought it was only grown-up people who
were Christians and dreadfully good, like
old Deacon Piper and Mr. Hagood, who spoke
in meetings.”</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>“This was just Endeavor meeting. But
then that isn’t so at all.” Ben’s tone was
emphatic. “Boys and girls can be Christians;
mother explained that to me years ago.
It’s just loving God best of all, and trying to
do as He wants us to. Folks don’t have
to wait till they are grown up to do that, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>are awfully good, either. I’m glad they
don’t, or there wouldn’t be much show for
me; my temper boils over about as quick as
Aunt Eunice’s teakettle. But I keep pegging
away at it, and I can hold on better than
I could, I know, for some of the folks I trade
with are enough to provoke a saint. But
that’s the only way to grow good—keep trying.
You can do that as well as anybody.
And you love God, don’t you?”</p>

<p>She shook her head as she answered mournfully,
“I’m afraid not. I know I don’t feel
about Him as you do.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” Ben said simply. “I wish
you did. You don’t know what a comfort it
is when you get in a tight place and things
seem to be mixed up all in a tangle, to feel
that God will make everything come out just
as is best for you. I really wish you did.”</p>

<p>Posey made no answer. She only reached
up and caught a handful of leaves from a
tree they were passing under, and asked Ben
what kind of leaves they were. At the same
time the fact that Ben Pancost, a boy who
had a freckled face, who laughed and joked
and told funny stories, who loved to skate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
to coast, to play baseball, and in short enjoyed
all the things that boys did, should talk
about loving God, and God’s taking care of
him, as though this was the most natural
thing in the world, made a deep impression
on her mind, and one that never was forgotten.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br>
<span class="fs80">A STORM, AND A SHELTER</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Ben’s story, here given as a whole, had
really been interrupted by one or two business
calls. It was evident, even to Posey,
that Ben was a decided favorite along the
route; for in addition to his boyish good-humor,
his obliging ways, as well as his
truthfulness and honesty, had won for him
many customers, and many friends among
his customers. Posey could hardly have told
if she more admired or was amused by the
brisk, alert way in which he sorted over the
bags of rags brought out to him, made his
bargains, and marshalled his array of tinware.</p>

<p>“The fact of the matter is,” he explained
to Posey as he was making a memorandum
in his note-book of one quart, and one two-quart
basin to be brought the next trip, “I’m
pretty well sold out of stock, except milk
pails, tin dippers, and nutmeg graters and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
the graters are a fancy kind at twenty-five
cents. That’s a little too high for them to
go easily. I guess I’ll tell Mr. Bruce—he’s
the man I work for—that he’d better not order
any more; things that run from ten to
twenty cents sell the best. That’s about
what a common bag of rags comes to, and
folks would rather not pay money besides.
I’d rather not pay money, either, for, you see,
besides the profit on the rags I buy, there’s
the profit on the goods I sell; so when I
haven’t what they want, if they will wait I
bring it next time I come, and I always take
pains to pick out what I think will suit, too.”</p>

<p>As it drew towards noon Posey suggested
that they share the rest of the contents of
her basket. But Ben urged, “Wait a little.”
And when a few moments later coming
over a hill they entered a small country
village he drew up before its modest hotel
with a flourish, remarking as he did so, “This
train stops twenty minutes for refreshments.”</p>

<p>“But, Ben,” expostulated Posey, “I’m
sure there’s enough for us both in the basket.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>“That will do for lunch this afternoon. I
tell you, the afternoons are pretty long.”</p>

<p>“But you know,” and Posey hesitated over
the words, “we will have to pay if we eat
here, and I haven’t any money.”</p>

<p>“Ho!” scoffed Ben. “I guess when I ask
a young lady to take a ride with me I can get
her a bite to eat; that’s the proper thing to
do. Besides, I never took a girl riding before,
that is, except my cousins, and I want to
do it up swell. Why, lots of the boys I know
are always asking the girls to go somewhere,
though what they can find to say to each
other is more than I can imagine. And Fred
Flood, only a year older’n I am, has been engaged.
He was engaged to Millie Grey for
two weeks, then they quarreled out, he burned
all her letters in the back yard, and they
haven’t spoken to each other since.</p>

<p>“I s’pose, though,” Ben’s tone was reflective,
“I shall come to it some day; write notes
to the girls, and go after ’em in my best
clothes an’ with a choke collar, as Cousin
George does. But I guess it will be some
time first,” and Ben laughed.</p>

<p>“It must make one feel real grown-up-like,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
though, to have a written invitation,” remarked
Posey. “I had a letter from a boy
once,” the dimples in her cheeks showing at
the recollection.</p>

<p>“What was in it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, there was a shield made with red
and blue crayons, and ‘U. S.’ in big letters at
the top and bottom of the paper; then it said,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="fs80">“‘<span class="smcap">Dear Posey</span>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry fs80">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘If you love me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As I love you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">No knife can cut</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Our love in two.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The boy sent it to me in school one day.”</p>

<p>“What did you write back?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. I didn’t like the boy, anyway.
Besides, I shouldn’t have known what to
write.”</p>

<p>“You might have written,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry fs80">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘The rose is red,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">The violet blue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Tansy is horrid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And so are you.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">And then they both laughed.</p>

<p>By this time a leisurely landlord in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
shirtsleeves had made his appearance, and
with a hand on each hip, stood calmly looking
them over. “I would like my horse fed, and
dinner for myself and this lady.” Ben’s
tone had its business accent as he jumped
down and helped Posey from the high seat to
the ground.</p>

<p>“All right,” and stepping forward the
landlord took the lines. “But seems to me
you’re rather a young couple. Wedding
trip, I s’pose?”</p>

<p>“Tin wedding!” and Ben gave a jerk of
his thumb towards the cart.</p>

<p>What a sumptuous banquet to Posey
seemed that dinner. Surely fried chicken
was never before so good, and baked potatoes
and squash so toothsome, or peaches
and cream so delicious; even the decidedly
slabby cake she ate with a relish. She had
recovered from her fatigue, her eyes shone,
her cheeks were flushed with pleasant excitement;
she was ready to laugh at all of Ben’s
nonsense, and the pleasantries of the good-natured
landlord who served them. While
Ben, delighted at her happy mood, as he
looked at her and listened to her merry laugh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
could hardly realize that this was the same
woeful little figure he had met so few hours
before.</p>

<p>They had not been long on the road again
when Ben began to cast doubtful glances at
a dark cloud swiftly rising in the west. “I’m
afraid we’re going to have a shower,” he
said at last. And then after a few moments,
“I know we are. I see the rain coming over
those woods now. It’s a mile or more away,
but it’s working this way fast.”</p>

<p>“What will you do?” Posey questioned
anxiously.</p>

<p>“I must try and get in somewhere. I’m
pretty well fixed for storms, with a big umbrella
and oilcloth apron. I’ve a cover for
the load, too, but the trouble is I’ve got so
many rags on now it won’t go over, so I must
find some place to drive in. Hurry up,
Billy,” and he shook the lines over the stout
bay’s back. “I don’t know this road, either.
I always go the one next south; it has more
houses, but the landlord said there was a
bridge down on it an’ I would have to come
this way.”</p>

<p>“It’s beginning to sprinkle,” and Posey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
held out her hand. “I feel the drops. But
there’s a house just ahead; perhaps you can
find a place there.”</p>

<p>As they neared the white farmhouse they
saw that a long woodhouse stretched from
one side, its old-fashioned arched opening
toward the road. “Can I drive under your
shed?” Ben shouted to an old lady he saw
just inside. And then as the first gust of the
swift-coming storm began to patter thick
about them, hardly waiting for a reply, he
turned Billy at a swinging trot up the drive,
and in another moment they were safe under
shelter, while a whitely driving sheet of rain
blotted out all the outer world.</p>

<p>“You was just in the nick o’ time, wasn’t
you?” said the little round-faced old lady,
who was busy catching and putting in a box a
flock of little turkeys that flew about the
woodhouse squawking and fluttering, while
the mother turkey shook her red head and
uttered a dissonant protest.</p>

<p>“You see,” she explained, “if turkey
chicks get wet it’s almost sure to kill ’em.
They’re the tenderest little creatures that
ever was to raise, an’ the hen turk’s no more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
sense than to trail out in the rain with ’em,
so I’m goin’ to put ’em where they’ll be safe.
It’s dreffle late to have little turks, but that
hen beats all to steal her nest, an’ seein’ she’s
hatched ’em I thought I’d try an’ help her
raise ’em. They’ll be good eatin’ along in
the winter.”</p>

<p>When the last scantily-feathered, long-necked
turkey chick had, with Ben and
Posey’s help, been captured and placed in
the box, and the mother turkey had mounted
the edge of it, they had time to notice the neat
rows in which the wood was piled, the ground
swept hard and clean as a floor, and the tin
wash-basin hanging over a bench beside the
pump scoured till it shone like silver. “I
guess it ain’t nothin’ but a shower,” chirruped
their hostess; “come into the house
an’ hev some cheers while you wait. I’m
glad you happened along, not that I’m afraid,
but it’s sort o’ lonesome-like to be alone in a
storm.”</p>

<p>As she talked she led the way through the
kitchen into a big sitting-room, where a new
rag carpet made dazzling stripes on the floor,
and the lounge and rocking-chair were gay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
with the brightest of chintz. Posey had already
decided that this was almost the nicest
old lady she had ever seen; there was something
at once placid and cheerful in both tone
and manner, and a kindly good-nature seemed
to radiate even from her black silk apron.
“I declare, for’t, if the rain isn’t blowin’ in
at that winder,” she exclaimed as she lowered
a sash.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you afraid the wind will blow
down those great trees on the house?” asked
Posey, as she glanced out a little fearfully at
the branches bending and twisting in the
storm.</p>

<p>“La, no, child,” was the placid answer;
“they’ve stood worse storms than this. I
don’t know what you would have done to
have lived here as I did when I was your age.
Right in the woods we was then, with the tall
trees all around the log house; an’ in a big
storm you could hear crash, crash—the trees
comin’ down in the woods, an’ didn’t know
what minute one would fall on the house.
Once there come a real tornado—a windfall,
they called it them days; a man in the next
town just stepped to the door to look out, an’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
a tree struck an’ killed him. Father cleared
away around our house, so there shouldn’t
be any danger, as soon as he could.”</p>

<p>“And did you live here when it was new
as that?” asked Ben, whose interest was at
once aroused by anything that smacked of
old-time stories.</p>

<p>“To be sure I did. This part of Ohio was
all woods when I come here. We come all
the way from Connecticut in a wagon, for
there wasn’t any other way o’ comin’ then;
my father drove a ‘spike team,’ that is, a
horse ahead of a yoke of oxen; we brought
what housen goods we could in the wagon,
an’ was forty days on the way. There wasn’t
a family in two miles at first, an’ nights we
used to hear the wolves howlin’ ’round the
house.”</p>

<p>“And how did you feel?” asked Posey
breathlessly.</p>

<p>The old lady laughed. “I was some
scared along at first, though we hadn’t no
great call to be afraid o’ them, it was the
sheep an’ young cattle they was after. Why,
along the first o’ father’s keepin’ sheep he
had to shut ’em up every night in a high pen;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
an’ after neighbors got so thick we had a
school a bear caught a pig one day, right in
sight o’ the schoolhouse.”</p>

<p>“What did you do?” questioned Ben.</p>

<p>“Oh, some of the boys ran for Mr. James,
who lived nearest. He came with his gun,
but the bear got away.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could have lived in those days,”
and Ben gave a long-drawn sigh over the
safe, commonplace period in which his lot
had been cast.</p>

<p>“I think myself mebby we took more comfort
then,” the old lady agreed with fond
retrospection. “We spun an’ wove all the
cloth we had; the shoemaker came around
from house to house to make the shoes—‘whippin’
the cat,’ they called it; when a deer
was killed all the neighbors had a share of
the venison, cooked before the big fireplace.
To be sure, there were <em>some</em> things that
wasn’t so pleasant. I remember once we
went without shoes till into December ’cause
the shoemaker couldn’t get around before;
an’ another time father went to mill—twenty
miles through the woods it was—he had to
wait three days for his grist to be ground;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
we hadn’t a mite o’ flour or meal in the house,
an’ mother sifted some bran to get the finest
an’ made it into bran bread. I tell you, the
boys an’ girls o’ to-day hain’t much idee o’
them times.”</p>

<p>She paused and looking at her listeners
asked Ben abruptly, “Is this your sister?”</p>

<p>Posey’s heart went pit-a-pat, but Ben answered
promptly, “No, ma’am, but she
wanted to go my way, so I’m giving her a
ride.”</p>

<p>She nodded. “I thought you didn’t favor
one another.”</p>

<p>At that moment the slamming of a blind in
an adjoining room called the old lady away
for a moment, and Posey seized the opportunity
to whisper to Ben, “She looks so nice
and kind, do you suppose she would let me
live with her?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say,” he whispered back, “but it
won’t do any harm to ask her.”</p>

<p>So when she returned, bringing a plate of
seed cookies for her guests, Posey hesitatingly
made the request.</p>

<p>“La, child, I don’t live alone,” was the
smiling answer. “My daughter Manda, an’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
Henry Scott, her husband, have lived with
me ever since my husband died. Not that I
couldn’t live alone,” she added quickly, “for
though I’m seventy-five I hold my age pretty
well, an’ chore about a considerable. The
reason I’m alone to-day is that Henry’s
mother is here on a visit. She’s one o’ them
wimmen that’s always on the go, an’ to-day
there wa’n’t no hold up but they must go over
to see Manda’s cousin Jane. They wanted
me to go with ’em, but I said no, I wasn’t
gwine joltin’ off ten mile as long as I had a
comfortable place to stay in. When folks
got to my age home was the best place for
’em, and I was gwine to stay there,” and she
gave a chirruping little laugh.</p>

<p>“Henry’s mother is younger’n I be—three
years, five months an’ fifteen days younger,
but she don’t begin to be so spry. Has to
have a nap every day; an’ she’s got eight different
medicines with her, an’ what she don’t
take she rubs on. It keeps her pretty busy
a takin’ an’ a rubbin’ on,” and she chuckled
again at what evidently seemed to her very
amusing in one younger than herself.</p>

<p>“How old be you?” she asked, her mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
coming back from Henry’s mother to Posey,
who was waiting with wondering eagerness.</p>

<p>“I shall be fourteen in December.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t very big of your age.”</p>

<p>“But I’m real strong,” urged Posey, who
experienced a sudden sense of mortification
that she was not larger.</p>

<p>“You look as though you might be,” and
the old lady looked over her glasses at the
well-knit, rounded little figure. “Where
have you been livin’?”</p>

<p>“Some fifteen miles from here,” answered
Posey, who felt that exact information would
not be prudent. “But I couldn’t stay there
any longer,” she hastily added, “and as I
haven’t any father or mother, I’d like to
find some nice people who wanted a girl to
live with and help them.”</p>

<p>“I really wish I knew of such a place for
you, but Mandy, my daughter, has all the
family she can see to; and none of the neighbors
needs any one. But I dare presume
you won’t have no trouble in findin’ some
one who wants just such a little girl.” So
the old lady cheerfully dismissed the subject
without dreaming how absolutely homeless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
she really was; and as the storm had now
passed over filled both their hands with cookies
and with a smiling face watched the tin-wagon
on its way again.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br>
<span class="fs80">A PARTING OF WAYS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>For a while Ben and Posey rode along
almost in silence over the roads beaten smooth
and clean by the heavy shower, while the wayside
ditches were still noisy little rills, and
the trees shook down showers of raindrops
with every passing breeze.</p>

<p>Posey, in spite of herself, could not help
a sorrowful feeling of discouragement at the
failure of her first effort at home-finding.
Not so much for the refusal itself, though
she felt that to live with such a cheery old
lady would be quite delightful, as the fear
that other attempts might be equally useless.</p>

<p>Ben, flicking his big bay horse softly with
the tassel of his whip, was evidently in a
brown study. At last he turned to Posey,
saying, “I’ve been thinking what you had
better do. I can’t take you home with me—as
I wish I could, for really I haven’t any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
home except as Uncle John gives me one, and
that’s forty miles from here and I don’t
expect to get there for a month or more;
besides the house is so full that Aunt Eunice
hardly knows where to put us all as it is.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t expect you to make a home
for me!” cried Posey.</p>

<p>“I’d like to. But last spring the man
whose route it was on was sick, so I went
over into Farmdale for one trip, and there
I saw such a nice old lady, nicer if anything
than the one we just stopped with. I guess
she took a fancy to me, for she wanted to
know if I had a sister. Said she wished she
could find a real nice little girl to live with
her, and asked me if I knew of any one I
thought would suit her. Now, Byfield’s the
next town, and Farmdale is only seven miles
from there, and I believe I’ll drive over there
with you to-night and see her. Maybe I
can pick up some rags on the way, and I
know Mr. Bruce won’t care when I tell him
about it.”</p>

<p>Posey at once agreed, and the faint anxiety
that had begun to rise in her mind as to what
she would do when it came night was at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
swept away, for in Ben Pancost and his ability
she had unlimited faith.</p>

<p>When they reached the straggling little
railroad station of Byfield, Ben said he must
go to the store and take on what paper rags
had been gathered in since his last trip, and
he left Posey to wait for him at Byfield’s
one small hotel while he did this.</p>

<p>It seemed to Posey that Ben was gone a
long, long time, and when at last he appeared
it was with a very sober face. “I’m awful
sorry, Posey,” were his first words, “but
when I got over to the store I found a telegram
there from Mr. Bruce to come to Cleveland
as quick as I could. He’s sent for me
that way before and I know what it means.
He’s got an order for rags and hasn’t enough
on hand to fill it. I just looked at to-day’s
market report in the paper and it gave paper
rags as ‘heavy with a downward tendency,’
so I suppose Mr. Bruce is afraid of a big
drop and wants to get his off at once. I’ve
agreed with a man here to change horses
till I come back. It’s four o’clock now and
with a fresh horse I can get to Cleveland by
ten or eleven, then the rags can be shipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
in the morning, and a day’s delay may make
a big difference to Mr. Bruce.”</p>

<p>“I see,” murmured Posey.</p>

<p>“So you see why I can’t go with you to
Farmdale, as I was going to. But I’ll tell
you how I’ve planned it. I’ve agreed with
the landlady for you to stay here all night,
and there’s a stage runs to Farmdale to-morrow
that you can go over in. The worst
of it is I don’t know the nice old lady’s name
or where she lives, for she wasn’t in her
own home when I saw her. But they called
her ‘aunt’ at the place she was, so they will
be sure to know all about her, and I can tell
you just where that is. The village is built
around the prettiest green you ever saw.
You go up on the west side till you come to
a story-and-half white house with green
blinds, and big lilac bushes at the gate;
there’s a sign over the front door, ‘Millinery,
and Dressmaking,’ so you can’t miss the
place.</p>

<p>“There were two ladies there, not young
or really old, but sort o’ between like, you
know. They were nice, too. Why, what do
you think one of them did? I had torn my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
coat on the wagon and she mended it for me.
Wasn’t that good? And I know they’ll be
good to you. Just tell them I sent you, and
as soon as I come back I’ll come and see how
you are getting along. I’m awful sorry
things have happened this way, but I don’t
see what else I can do.”</p>

<p>Ben had talked very fast, and as Posey
listened she was conscious that a lump was
rising higher and higher in her throat. “It’s
all right, Ben,” Posey tried to speak with
forced cheerfulness. “Only it seems as
though I’d known you always, and I don’t
quite know what to do without you,” and
with all her effort her voice trailed off in a
quiver.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s so,” Ben’s tone was emphatic.
“It does seem as though we had always
known each other, don’t it?”</p>

<p>“And you’ve been <em>so</em> good to me,” Posey
continued. “I shall never forget it, Ben,
never! This has been the happiest day I
ever knew.”</p>

<p>“Shucks!” exclaimed Ben, his own voice a
trifle husky. “I haven’t done anything but
let you ride on the tin-cart; that wasn’t much,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
I’m sure. Besides I’ve enjoyed it as much
as you have.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you have been good to me,” she
repeated. “You came to me when I hadn’t
anybody in the whole world, and I was feeling
so badly that I almost wanted to die.
Except my mamma nobody in all my life was
ever so good to me, not even dear Mr. Hagood,
and I shall remember it always.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could have done more for you;
and here—” slipping a couple of silver dollars
into her hand—“is a little money for
your stage fare, and anything else you may
need. I’ve settled with the landlady for
your staying here to-night.”</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t take it, Ben,” Posey protested,
as she tried to force the money back.
“You’ve paid for my dinner, and now for
to-night, and you have to work hard for your
money. I sha’n’t take it, indeed I sha’n’t.
I can walk to Farmdale to-morrow as well
as not.”</p>

<p>“Shucks!” retorted Ben more emphatically
than before. “You won’t do anything
of the kind. Besides I’m going to adopt you
for my sister, and brothers ought to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
care of their sisters. When I get a raise
in my salary I’ll send you to a fashionable
boarding school. But I must be off, only I
feel dreadfully to leave you so.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Posey bravely.
“You said God took care of me to-day, perhaps
He will to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” answered Ben. “You and I’ll
both ask Him, and I know He will. And
I’ll be around to Farmdale to see you by
next week, sure; so good-by till then.” And
squeezing Posey’s hand till it would have
brought tears to her eyes had they not been
there already, he hurried away, while Posey
stood at the window and watched the red
cart, a grotesque object, with its dangling
fringe of old rubber boots, the sacks of rags
piled high on top and hiding from her view
the driver, as it went down the street
and slowly lessened in the distance. Then
she turned away with a sigh, for Ben Pancost
had passed beyond her sight.</p>

<p>With his going the brightness seemed to
fade from the day. The fallen leaves of a
maple before the hotel drifted with a dreary
little rustle in the rising wind. The floor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
of the room was covered with oilcloth on
which her chair, whenever she moved it,
made a mournful sound that increased her
sense of loneliness. The long dining-room
looked empty and forlorn when she answered
the summons to supper and found herself and
a traveller out of temper, because he had
missed his train, its only occupants.</p>

<p>As the dusk deepened, Posey heard the
merry voices of children in the street, but
she herself felt strangely old and unchildlike
with a burden of anxiety resting on her, and
the memory of trouble and care and perplexity
rising like a cloud behind her. A
kitten came capering into the room; she
coaxed it to her and tried to cuddle the ball
of fur in her arms, feeling even that companionship
would be something; but the
kitten was of a roving nature and had rather
have its own frolicsome way than her tending.
When the kerosene lamp was brought
in it smoked, and through the dingy chimney
the big figured paper and the cheap chromos
on the wall looked more staring than before.
Posey during her years with Madam
Sharpe had known a varied experience with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
the parlors of cheap hotels and boarding-houses
with their threadbare carpets and
shabby, broken-springed furniture, but she
was sure that she never saw so cheerless a
room as that of the Byfield hotel.</p>

<p>No doubt after all Posey had been through
in the last twenty-four hours a reaction was
sooner or later bound to come. So it was
not strange that she should suddenly have
become conscious of being very, very tired,
as well as exceedingly sleepy, and before
eight o’clock she asked to be shown to her
room, where she soon fell asleep with Ben
Pancost’s silver dollars clasped close in her
hand against her cheek. For those dollars
stood to her not only as actual value, but
as kindliness and helpfulness, the sole friendship
she had to rest on a friend near and
human, while that of God, whose care for the
morrow she had duly remembered to ask,
seemed to her heavy little heart as far off
and mysterious.</p>

<p>When Posey woke the next morning after
a long, dreamless sleep, she started up as if
expecting to hear Mrs. Hagood’s voice calling
her, and a dog she heard barking outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
she thought for a moment was Rover. But
her unfamiliar surroundings quickly brought
to her all that had happened, and she lay
back on her pillow with a feeling of surprise
that it should all be true. “I wonder what
will happen to me to-day, and where I shall
be to-night?” she said to herself. “But Ben
said he knew God would take care of me,”
and Ben’s faith became her confidence.</p>

<p>With morning, too, the world looked decidedly
brighter than it had the evening before;
she had a good appetite for her breakfast,
and when the landlady who served the
table in person explained that the table
waiter went away to a dance and hadn’t come
back, and the cook was sick that morning,
and she had everything to do and didn’t
know which way to turn, Posey at once offered
to help. “The stage doesn’t go for a
long time yet, and I’d just as soon wash the
dishes as not,” and following out into the
kitchen she was soon plunged in a pan of
foamy suds.</p>

<p>“You are good help,” was the landlady’s
comment. “My husband’s dead and I have
the whole business to see to, and the profit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
isn’t much, but I’ll give you a dollar a week
to wash dishes if you’ll stay with me.”</p>

<p>Posey hesitated; work was what she
wanted, but the landlady’s voice had a sharp
accent and there were fretty wrinkles between
her eyes. “I promised to go to an
old lady in Farmdale,” she answered after a
moment, “but if I don’t get a place there I’ll
come back to you.”</p>

<p>Posey had taken pains to shake and brush
out the dust and all she could of the disorder
from her clothes. Before stage time she repacked
the contents of her bundle, and begging
a newspaper and string made it into a
neat looking package, and when the stage
started out it was a tidy little figure that occupied
a corner of the back seat. The ride
to Farmdale through the pleasant country
roads was all too short for Posey, who once
more found herself among strangers, a solitary
waif.</p>

<span class="fs80">A DOOR OPENS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The stage stopped at the business end of
Farmdale. Around three sides of a sandy
square were grouped the village hotel, the
post-office, and its few stores and shops; on
the fourth side this square opened on a long
stretch of velvety green turf, around which,
set in deep yards, surrounded by trees, and
embowered in shrubbery, were the comfortable,
well-ordered village homes. In the centre
of this green, and midway its length a
fountain was falling into a circular stone
basin and from that flowing into a stone
watering-trough, where a white horse with
a barefooted boy on its back was drinking.
Beyond the fountain the ground rose
slightly and crowning this gentle swell three
white churches set side by side lifted their
spires against the blue sky.</p>

<p>Posey walked slowly along the maple-shaded
path, with bright colored leaves above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
her and bright colored leaves rustling under
her feet, charmed with the peaceful air, the
quiet beauty, and looking carefully for a
house to answer Ben Pancost’s description.
It was not long till she saw it—a modest
white house with green blinds, the walls almost
covered with climbing roses and honeysuckles,
while over the front door hung the
sign, its gilt lettering somewhat faded by
time and storms,</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent fs80 wsp">
MILLINERY AND DRESSMAKING.<br>
</p>
<br>

<p>A great lilac bush stood on each side of
the small white gate by which she entered,
while syringas, flowering quince, and thickets
of roses gave promise of springtime bloom.
The narrow, stone-flagged walk that led to
the side door was fringed with flowers, and
ran along the edge of a grassy bank or low
terrace, below which were more flower beds
bordered with China pinks, besides homelier
beds of garden vegetables, while under sheltering
rows of currant bushes a flock of white
chickens rolled in the dirt at their ease. Beyond
the house lay an orchard, and the side
porch at which the walk ended was shaded by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
a great grapevine heavy with purple clusters.
A Maltese cat, sunning itself in sleepy
content on the steps, roused as she came up
and rubbed against her with a friendly purr.
Over all the sunny little homestead rested
an air of thrift, order, peace, that filled
Posey with a sense of restfulness; why she
could hardly have told.</p>

<p>Her knock on the green-paneled door was
answered by Miss Silence Blossom, one of
the two whom Ben Pancost had described as
“not young, or really old,” but with the
brightness of youth still lingering in her
eyes and her smile. The room into which she
led Posey was large and sunny with windows
facing the south. In one corner was an
open sewing machine from which she had
evidently just risen. In another corner
stood a square table covered with boxes of
flowers and ribbons beside which trimming
a bonnet sat Mrs. Patience Bird, a younger
sister of Miss Silence, her sweet, gentle face
touched by a shade of sadness, reflected in
the mourning dress she still wore for the
young husband whose picture was in the little
pin at her throat. Behind the low chair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
in which she sat was a tall case with long
glass doors, filled with ribbons, flowers, and
hats, all in orderly array, for though this
was the work-room of busy workers there
was no trace of litter or confusion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blossom, the mother, with a strong
but kindly face, was watering a stand of
house plants. She, too, was a widow, but
of more than half a lifetime. The years
when she had gathered her fatherless children
around her and, still a young woman,
taken up a life alone and bravely for herself
and them had left their lines of energy, decision,
and firmness. And, last of the family
group, in a large armchair by one of the
sunny windows with some white knitting in
her hands, sat an old lady, whose peaceful
face not less than her drab dress, close white
cap, and snowy, folded kerchief, told that she
was of the Quaker faith.</p>

<p>Posey took the chair offered her, suddenly
embarrassed and shy under the gaze of so
many questioning eyes, and at last stammered
abruptly, “Ben said you would know where
the old lady lived.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“Ben who; and what old lady?” demanded
Miss Silence, who in spite of her name was
the talker of the family.</p>

<p>“Why, the nice old lady who wants a girl
to live with her. And you know Ben; he’s
the boy who drives the red tin peddler’s
cart.”</p>

<p>“I know who she means,” spoke Mrs. Patience.
“It is the boy who came here last
summer that Aunt Maria Ames took such a
fancy to, and asked him if he hadn’t a sister
to live with her. I think,” to her mother,
“you and Grandmother were away that day.
Don’t you remember, Silence, you mended his
coat for him?”</p>

<p>By this time Posey had found her tongue.
“Yes,” she hastened to add, “Ben said you
did. He said he knew you were the best kind
of Christians.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Blossom smiled. “I hope Ben was
right, though that seems to have been a case
of judging faith by works.”</p>

<p>“Well, Ben Pancost knows,” asserted Posey
stoutly.</p>

<p>“He certainly impressed me as a very good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
boy,” said Miss Silence, “truthful, frank,
and manly. And so you wanted to come and
live with Mrs. Ames?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am, Ben was almost sure she
would let me.”</p>

<p>“That is too bad, for she has gone to Chicago
to spend the winter with her daughter.”</p>

<p>Posey’s face clouded with dismay. She
had trusted implicitly to Ben. What should
she do if his plan for her failed?</p>

<p>Mrs. Blossom saw the look. “What is
your name?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Posey.”</p>

<p>“And whose Posey?” Mrs. Patience questioned
looking up from her work with a gentle
smile.</p>

<p>“Nobody’s,” was the mournful answer.</p>

<p>“And where is your home?” continued
Mrs. Blossom.</p>

<p>“Nowhere,” answered Posey, a great sense
of her forlornness rushing over her and filling
her eyes with tears.</p>

<p>“Now, see here,” Miss Silence’s tone was
brisk and incisive; “you want to tell the
truth. Everybody has a surname and lives
somewhere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>“I have told the truth,” protested Posey
hotly. “I haven’t anybody or any home
anywhere.”</p>

<p>“But where have you been living?”</p>

<p>Now Posey had gathered from Ben Pancost’s
manner that while he personally approved
of her running away from Mrs.
Hagood, he was doubtful of the impression
it might make on others, and she had resolved
to be very discreet and tell as little
of that part of her story as possible. But
her indignation at the implication of untruthfulness
overmastered her prudence and
she answered, “If you want to know where
I’ve lived I can tell you. I’ve lived with a
clairvoyant medium, and I’ve lived at the
Refuge in Cleveland, and the last place I’ve
lived was with a Mrs. Hagood in Horsham.”</p>

<p>“Why, Horsham is twenty miles from
here.”</p>

<p>“I wish it was twenty million miles.”</p>

<p>“But why?”</p>

<p>“Because,” her voice rising shrill with
passion, “Mrs. Hagood was horrid to me,
and I ran away from her, I did; and I don’t
care who knows it, I don’t; and I’ll never go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
back to her for anybody, never,” her cheeks
flushing and her eyes flashing through her
tears.</p>

<p>“In what way was Mrs. Hagood horrid to
you?” questioned Mrs. Blossom.</p>

<p>For answer Posey tore open her collar
and rolled up her sleeves showing the marks
still visible on her neck and arms. It needed
now hardly an inquiry to bring out the whole
story, in which she omitted neither what she
had said to Mrs. Hagood nor the bite she had
given her hand. “And I’ll starve and die
before I’ll go back to her,” she added in conclusion.</p>

<p>“It’s a burning shame to treat a child like
that, I don’t care what she had done!” exclaimed
Miss Silence. And Mrs. Patience
added in her gentle tone, “Poor child!
wouldn’t you like something to eat?” for
Mrs. Patience had the idea that children were
in a perpetual state of hunger.</p>

<p>“Was this Mrs. Hagood always cruel to
you?” questioned Mrs. Blossom.</p>

<p>Posey hesitated a moment. “No, ma’am,
I guess not. She gave me plenty to eat, but
she scolded me from morning till night, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
wanted me to work every minute. If she
wasn’t always cruel she was never kind—”
She paused and looked from face to face—“and
now I’m away from her I’m going to
stay away. The landlady at the hotel at Byfield
will give me a dollar a week to wash
dishes, but I wish you knew of some other
place where I could live. I’d do everything I
could to help, and I’d be real good. I’m not
bad always, indeed I’m not.” She did not
say, “If I might only stay here,” but her
wistful eyes expressed the unspoken wish.</p>

<p>“Silence,” Mrs. Blossom spoke quickly,
“will you go out in the orchard and get some
sweet apples to bake; and Posey can go with
you.”</p>

<p>“Now, mother,” Miss Silence laid down
in her lap the work she held, “I don’t think
it’s quite fair to send the child away while
you and Grandmother talk her over, for she
knows as well as I that’s what you would do.
There’s only one thing <em>I</em> shall consent to—that
she stay here till a suitable place is found
for her.”</p>

<p>“Thee will always be the same impulsive,
impetuous Silence as long as thee lives.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
Grandmother Sweet’s face crinkled in a
smile. Though an attentive listener she had
not spoken before. She turned to her daughter,
“I have nothing to say for my part,
Elizabeth, that the young girl might not hear,
indeed that I would not prefer she should
hear.</p>

<p>“And in the first place, my dear,” to
Posey, “thee is not free from blame thyself;
from thy own words thee has failed in duty
to one older than thyself, and yielded to
the angry passion of thine own heart, and
thus, it well may be, has failed of the lesson
God meant for thee. For always remember,
child, God puts us in no place he will not
give us strength to fill, or sends us no trial
that will not be for our good if rightly endured.
At the same time if thy story is
true, and thee has a truthful look, I do not
think thee has been justly or rightly treated,
or that thy return would be wise or best.”</p>

<p>Then turning again to her daughter,
“The leading of the Lord seems to have
brought her to our door. What is thy mind,
Elizabeth?”</p>

<p>“Thee has spoken it exactly,” answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
Mrs. Blossom, who often used the Friends’
language in talking with her mother. “As
thee says, she seems to have been led to us,
and I hope the time will never come when
any of God’s children find ours a closed
door.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if you will let me stay I’ll do my very
best!” cried Posey. “Do you know I said
yesterday that I didn’t believe God cared
anything for me, but Ben Pancost said He
did, that probably God sent him to help me
then, and that He would take care of me
again to-day, and I just think He has.”</p>

<p>“Dear child,” and Grandmother Sweet put
one of her soft, tremulous hands on Posey’s
head, “God’s love and care is over thee always;
never doubt it, even if thee has not the
outward evidence.”</p>

<p>“I am going out to Cleveland next week
for goods,” remarked Mrs. Patience, “and
I can go out to the Refuge and arrange about
Posey.”</p>

<p>Miss Silence nodded. “Yes, and you know
Cousin Allen Gloin’s wife has a sister in
Horsham; she will doubtless know of this
Mrs. Hagood.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>Posey lifted her head proudly, “I hope you
will see everybody who knows me, and ask
them all about me, for then you will find that
I have told the truth.”</p>

<p>“We are not doubting your word,” Miss
Silence assured her; “it is on your account
as well as ours that we want to learn as much
as possible.”</p>

<p>“All the same I want you to know that it
is true,” she answered. “And—” hesitating
a little, “if you know some one in Horsham
couldn’t I send a word to Mr. Hagood? He
will worry about me, I know he will, and
he was always so kind that I wish he could
know where I am and how good you are to
let me stay. He won’t tell Mrs. Hagood anything
about it. I am sure he won’t.”</p>

<span class="fs80">POSEY BECOMES ROSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Thus it was that Posey, who for so long
had been drifted at the mercy of adverse
currents found herself, for a time at least,
in a safe and quiet harbor. Very quickly she
fell into the simple household ways; she
washed the dainty old china for Mrs. Blossom;
she dusted the carefully kept rooms;
she pulled bastings and whipped edges for
Miss Silence; she ripped braid and wound
ribbons for Mrs. Patience, watching her the
while as with hat-block in lap her deft fingers
“sewed over” a hat or bonnet into a different
shape—for at that time this was part
of the work of a village milliner; and last
but by no means least she listened to Grandmother
Sweet’s gentle counsels and gentler
admonitions. While in this atmosphere of
cheer and kindliness her young heart that
had known such scant measure of either, expanded
like a flower in the sunshine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>From the first time she heard it the name
Posey had been anything but pleasing to
Grandmother Sweet’s Quaker ears, and the
next day after her coming, when she had
given as full an account as she could of her
varied life, the old lady began to question
her.</p>

<p>“And now what is thy real name, my
child? For surely thy mother never gave
thee ‘Posey’ for a life name.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as I have any other,” answered
Posey in surprise, for it was something
she had never thought of before.
“My mother, I can remember, often called
me ‘Rose,’ and her ‘little Rose,’ but she
called me ‘Posey,’ too; so did my father and
the neighbors, and Madam Sharpe, and I
always supposed that was all the name I
had.”</p>

<p>“Thee can depend upon it,” was the old
lady’s decided answer, “‘Posey’ was only
that foolish custom—a nickname—of which I
cannot approve.</p>

<p>“And as to thy surname, does thee not
know that either? It seems anything but
right that thee should continue to bear—especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
as it is not thy own, the name of
that wicked adventuress.”</p>

<p>Posey shook her head. “You know I was
so little when my mother and father died,
and Madam Sharpe called me by her name
from the first. I think she wanted me to
forget all I could for fear I might find some
one who would take me away from her. I
know whenever I asked her what my name
was she would say she had forgotten, but I
didn’t believe her then. Lately, I have tried
to remember it, but I can’t. I know my
mother’s first name was Kate, because I have
her Bible, and that is the name written in
it.”</p>

<p>“Will thee let me see it?”</p>

<p>Posey at once brought the little velvet covered
Bible, and the book of child verse, now
decidedly the worse for wear and age. On
the fly leaf of the Bible was primly written,
“Kate, from Aunt Sarah.”</p>

<p>In the other book was apparently no writing,
but after examining it a moment grandmother
asked, “Silence, will thee bring me a
damp sponge? If I am not mistaken a leaf
has been pasted down here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>The sponge was brought, and the page
when moistened readily lifted, proving
Grandmother Sweet’s suspicion correct, and
revealing to the onlookers, written in a delicate
hand,</p>

<p>“To Rose Shannon, on her fourth birthday,
December 12th.”</p>

<p>“There!” Grandmother Sweet’s tone was
triumphant, “now we have thy rightful
name, and thee shall be Rose to us, as thee
was to thy mother,” and she patted the curly
brown head.</p>

<p>“But why do you suppose she pasted the
leaf down instead of tearing it out?” questioned
Miss Silence.</p>

<p>“I think,” replied Posey, or rather Rose,
“it was because the colored picture on the
other side of the leaf was a favorite of mine,
and if it was gone I would be sure to miss
it.”</p>

<p>So it was without any purpose of her own,
or a thought on the part of any one of concealing
her identity, that with the very beginning
of life under new conditions Posey
Sharpe became Rose Shannon, and, or so it
seemed to her, with the old name the old life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
also dropped away. Rose was delighted to
possess a name that was hers by right, that
was her very own, but at first it sounded
strangely unfamiliar, and sometimes she
failed to recognize it as belonging to herself;
but very soon she grew as accustomed to it
as to the placid round of the Blossom household.</p>

<p>In a short time Mrs. Patience made her
trip to Cleveland, and made the promised
call at the Refuge. Here she found that a letter
had been received from Mrs. Hagood, full
of complaints that Posey was an idle, troublesome,
ungrateful girl, who had left her for
no cause whatever; but at the same time demanding
that she be sent back at once. For
Mrs. Hagood had supposed, as Rose thought,
that she would return to the Refuge. Mrs.
Patience’s account, however, put the matter
in a very different light. The superintendent
was deeply indignant, and as the Blossoms
had friends who were known to him,
he gladly consented that she should remain
with them till a more permanent provision
could be made.</p>

<p>It was on this one point of Rose’s history,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
the cause and manner of her leaving Mrs. Hagood,
that the Blossoms decided reticence to
be best. As Mrs. Blossom said, “Mrs. Hagood
is a stranger to us, and admitting that
she was at fault, it seems to me neither kind
nor right to repeat what might give others an
unfavorable impression.”</p>

<p>Gentle Grandmother Sweet’s advice to
Rose was, “The best way to keep from speaking
of it is to put it out of thy thoughts,
through that spirit of forgiveness, which we
who err so often should always be ready to
show.”</p>

<p>Not long after Mrs. Patience’s return from
the city Rose received an offer of a home
for the winter, with fifty cents a week wages,
and the privilege of attending school afternoons.
As she had seldom possessed a cent
she could call her own this seemed like a
small fortune; besides, as she had told Ben
Pancost, she understood more than most of
her age what it cost to live, and so was the
quicker to see that with all the Blossoms’
generous hospitality, economy was carefully
considered. For they were far from rich,
this houseful of women with no outside breadwinner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
to depend on, and with her sturdy,
independent nature Rose shrank from being
a burden on them, the more so because of
their affectionate kindness. Miss Silence
and Mrs. Patience having taken Rose under
their wing were unwilling she should go, unless
into a permanent home, but Mrs. Blossom
held that Rose should decide the question
for herself, especially as she would still
be in the village where they could watch
over her. While Grandmother Sweet placidly
observed, “Providence seems to have
opened the place for Rose, and the openings
of Providence are usually for some wise purpose.”</p>

<p>The offer had been most unexpected.
Miss Fifield had come to Silence Blossom to
have a dress fitted, and in the familiar conversation
which accompanied the process she
had remarked that she and her sister were
doing their work themselves as the hired
girl had gone home sick. “Of course,” she
explained, “we have Ellen Gill in to do the
washing and ironing and scrubbing; not but
that we could do it all, for it was my father’s
boast that his daughters were thoroughly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
capable. And they all are but Eudora; she
will not, and while I’m willing to do my
share I’m not willing to do mine and other
people’s too. I don’t believe Eudora would
soil her hands if her life depended on it. If
you’ll believe me, Silence Blossom, she has
gone and made a mop to wash dishes with.
It makes me sick, it positively does, to see
her mopping the dishes off, and lifting them
out with a fork, for fear the dishwater will
make her hands rough.” And Miss Fifield,
tall, spare, and angular, who counted all attempt
at personal adornment the sign of a
weak mind, gave a little sniff of contempt.</p>

<p>At this moment Rose came into the sitting-room
to bring Grandmother Sweet a piece of
fresh sponge cake, her first triumph in real
cake-making under Mrs. Blossom. Miss
Fifield through the partly open door of the
bedroom which also served as fitting-room,
regarded her neat gingham work-apron and
animated, rosy face with evident approval.</p>

<p>“Who is that young girl?” she asked. “I
don’t remember to have ever seen her before.”</p>

<p>“She is Rose Shannon,” Miss Silence answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
as well as she could with her mouth
full of pins. “She came to Farmdale with
the idea that she could live with Aunt Maria
Ames, and is staying with us for the present.”</p>

<p>Miss Fifield prided herself on her prompt
decisions, and the idea at once occurred to
her that such a tidy little handmaid would
be pleasant and useful to have.</p>

<p>“If she wants to she can come to us; we
will give her a home, and something besides.”</p>

<p>Silence Blossom was measuring Miss
Fifield’s bony arm for the sleeve. “I don’t
know,” her voice dubious; “Rose was planning
to go to school when it opened next
term.”</p>

<p>“I think we could manage for her to go
afternoons; there isn’t much to do after dinner.
I suppose,” she added, “that Eudora
and Brother Nathan will object. They never
agree on anything only in opposing me, but
what I undertake I intend to carry through.”</p>

<p>But for once Miss Fifield was mistaken,
Miss Eudora heartily agreed with the plan.
She could put on gloves to sweep, and cake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
and pastry making were something any lady
might do with dignity; but dish-washing even
with the aid of a mop, she viewed with horror.
Furthermore, her sister refused to
wash the dishes a day over half the time.</p>

<p>Squire Nathan Fifield, the middle-aged
brother who with the two middle-aged sisters
made up the Fifield family, caustically remarked
that he should think two able-bodied
women could do the work for themselves and
one man, but if they couldn’t they would have
to settle the matter their own way. “Only,”
he warned them, “it is very likely this is the
child of low-bred foreigners, and if she turns
out to be a little liar, and a thief, I want you
to remember that it was you that brought her
here, not me.”</p>

<p>But the sisters, noways daunted by this
foreboding, offered Rose the place and, as we
have seen, she accepted the offer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br>
<span class="fs80">AT THE FIFIELDS’</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The Fifields were the oldest family in
Farmdale, and lived in the most pretentious
house. Rose had greatly admired the old
home with its high-pillared porch set behind
tall hedges of prim cedar, and a view of the
interior only increased the feeling. To her
eyes the claw-footed tables and tall bedsteads
with canopy tops were most imposing; and
the dimly lighted, seldom used parlor with
its real lace curtains, its carpet laid in great
wreaths of roses, its gilt-framed mirror, and
its damask upholstered, mahogany furniture,
was a really magnificent apartment, including
as it did the family portraits, and Miss
Eudora’s girlish efforts at painting on velvet.</p>

<p>Rose’s position in the family had been the
subject of some discussion, for Eudora Fifield
had all her life sighed for a maid arrayed
in a white cap and apron, and it had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
been one of her numerous grievances that of
the array of independent spirited help who
had filed in and out of the Fifield kitchen one
and all had flatly refused to conform to such
usage.</p>

<p>“But Rose,” she argued, “has been
brought up in a city, where the manners of
the lower classes are so different. Why,
when I visited Aunt Morgan in Albany, her
servants treated me with a deference you
never see here. Her parlor-maid always
brought in the callers’ cards and the letters
on a salver; perhaps she would be willing to
do that.”</p>

<p>Jane Fifield gave a snort, “As long as
Nathan brings your letters in his coat pocket
and hands them to you, and we haven’t a
caller once a month, I think you won’t have
much use for a salver. Besides the Blossoms
make her one of the family, and Mrs.
Blossom particularly said that she should
never consent to her going to any place
where she would not be taken an interest
in, but simply thought of as a little drudge.”</p>

<p>Miss Eudora drew a little sigh at the vanishing
of the cap and salver, but quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
caught herself as she remembered the dish-washing.
“Well,” she admitted, “I suppose
it’s better to concede some points than not
have her come at all.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“I wonder,” suddenly spoke Silence Blossom
as she sat basting the facing on a skirt
the day after Rose left, “how Rose is getting
on at the Fifields’, and if she has heard anything
yet about Eudora’s visit to Albany?
I don’t believe I’ve seen her any time since
that she hasn’t made some reference to it.
I have often wondered what she would have
done if she hadn’t made that visit.”</p>

<p>“But you know,” urged Mrs. Patience,
“she and Jane both live such monotonous
lives, with hardly an interest outside themselves,
how can they help but go over the same
thing again and again?”</p>

<p>“I can tell one thing that would have happened
if Eudora had not made that Albany
visit,” remarked Mrs. Blossom, who from
an adjoining room had overheard the conversation,
“she would have been a happier
woman to-day. She came back from that
taste of city life completely out of tune with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
everything and everybody in Farmdale, and
she has never got in tune since.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid,” observed Grandmother
Sweet placidly, “that thee is sitting in judgment
on thy neighbors.”</p>

<p>“La, Grandmother,” and Miss Silence’s
brisk, heartsome laugh rippled out, “a body
can’t help having opinions, though I don’t always
express mine outside the family. And
you know what we said of Jane and Eudora
was true.”</p>

<p>“I know,” admitted Grandmother Sweet
with a sigh, “though we ought to look even
at truth with the eyes of charity. But I have
a hope that the coming of a fresh young life,
like Rose’s, into the Fifield home, if only for
a season, will bring a fresh interest and
brightness with it.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As for Rose, she had been but a little while
with the Fifields till she began to realize the
difference between that and the Blossoms.
Especially was she quick to notice the petty
friction, the note of jarring discord, that
made up the atmosphere at the Fifields’.
What one wanted another was sure to object<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
to, what one said was immediately disputed;
the sisters nagged Mr. Nathan, and he in turn
nagged his sisters. No doubt at heart they
loved each other, but the delicate consideration
for each other’s wishes, and the gentle
courtesy of affection, that so brightened the
Blossom home was wholly absent here.</p>

<p>Another thing she could not but see was the
prevailing tone of discontent. Though the
lives of Miss Fifield and Miss Eudora were
much easier than those of Miss Silence and
Mrs. Patience, the one was always complaining
of the dullness of Farmdale, and the
other making bitter reflections on life in general.
Had Rose come directly from Mrs.
Hagood’s all this might have escaped her
notice, but her stay in the white cottage with
its sweet-spirited inmates had given her a
glimpse of a different life, an ideal that would
always linger with her.</p>

<p>As the two houses were not the length of
the green apart Rose was a frequent visitor
at the Blossoms’. “Did your plants freeze
last night?” she asked as she came in one
afternoon. “Miss Eudora lost some of her
very prettiest ones. She says it was because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
Mr. Nathan didn’t fix the fire right,
and he says it was because she didn’t put the
window down tight. They were quarreling
over it when I came away, and yesterday they
disputed all day whether the meat bill came
in Tuesday or Wednesday.”</p>

<p>“There, there, Rose,” interrupted Mrs.
Blossom, “you are a member of the Fifield
family now, and have no right to repeat or
we to listen to anything you may see or hear
there.”</p>

<p>Grandmother Sweet laid down her knitting,
“As thee goes through life, Rose, thee will
find many people whose lives seem not to be
ordered by the law of love; at such times always
remember that silence is not only the
part of prudence but of true charity. At the
same time thee can learn to avoid the mistakes
thee sees others make.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Rose spoke with emphasis, “I
will try to avoid the mistake of squabbling
all the time over trifles—I’m not saying that
any one does so, you know, and when I get to
be an old lady I’m going to be as gentle and
lovely as Grandmother Sweet,” and she gave
her a hug and a kiss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>On her part Rose had gone to the Fifields’
with the firm resolve to do her very best.
On her first coming to the Blossoms’, while
her nerves were still keyed up in a tension
of excitement, little had been said to her in
regard to the manner of her leaving Mrs.
Hagood. But after she had calmed down
to her normal self Mrs. Blossom had talked
to her very seriously of the danger of yielding
to passion and impulse, and had shown
her that in spite of all she had to endure
what trouble she might easily have brought
on herself, and how much worse off she might
have been because of her hasty action. So
that Rose instead of thinking it a very fine,
brave act to have run away, as she was at
first inclined, began to feel that it was something
to regret, and be ashamed of, and because
of which she must do exceedingly well
indeed, to win and hold a high opinion.</p>

<p>As Rose was neat and deft, and above all
anxious to please, she soon became quite a
favorite with the two middle-aged Fifield sisters,
and Miss Eudora inclined to make a
confidante of her.</p>

<p>“So you have lived in cities most of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
life?” she said one morning as Rose was
dusting her room.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I like the country better.”</p>

<p>“You do?” exclaimed Miss Eudora, pausing
with a curl half brushed, for, unlike her
sister, she affected the willowy, the languishing;
she liked garments that flowed, ribbons
that fluttered, and still framed her little
wrinkled face in the curls that had been the
pride of her girlhood.</p>

<p>“Now, I think it is perfectly delightful to
live in a city. I spent a winter in Albany,
with my Aunt Morgan some years ago.
What a winter that was—” and she clasped
her hands, “one round of gayety and amusement.
Aunt made a large party for me, I
shall have to show you a piece of the dress
I wore. Aunt said she was proud of me
that night, and I’m sure,” with a little simper,
“I had compliments enough. I suppose,”
and she gave her grey curls a toss,
“it’s my own fault that I’m not living in
Albany to-day.”</p>

<p>“If you liked it so well why didn’t you
stay?” asked Rose.</p>

<p>“When a young girl has the admiration I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
had, she doesn’t always know what she does
want. But I can tell you I made quite an impression
on Some One that evening.”</p>

<p>“How did you look then?” Rose was trying
to imagine Miss Eudora as a young girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, just as I do now,” with a complacent
glance in her mirror. “I haven’t changed
as some people do. Not long ago I met a
friend—well, an old admirer, and he said he
would like to know what I did to keep myself
so young; that I didn’t look any older
than I did when he first knew me. I think
my hair may have something to do with that;
curls do have a youthful effect. That’s the
reason, I believe, Jane is always wanting me
to put mine back.</p>

<p>“Jane,” and she sank her voice to a whisper,
“was always plain, and never received
the admiration, or was the favorite with gentlemen
I was, and it has always made her
jealous of me. But I’m fond of my curls,”
giving them a shake. “Why, I even had a
poem written on them once, and I sha’n’t put
them up, at least not till I begin to grow
old.”</p>

<p>Rose listened in amazement. She was sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
Miss Silence was younger than Miss Eudora,
her hair was not grey, nor her face marked
with such little fine lines, and neither she nor
Mrs. Patience ever talked like that. It was
all very queer, and most of all that Miss Eudora
<em>could</em> fancy that she looked young.</p>

<p>“You were a long time doing the chamberwork,”
Miss Fifield remarked when Rose
went downstairs. Miss Fifield was in the
kitchen baking, her scant house dress clinging
to her angular figure, and her grey hair
drawn back with painful tightness.</p>

<p>Rose noted the contrast between the two
sisters as she answered, “Miss Eudora was
talking to me.”</p>

<p>“What about?” a trifle sharply.</p>

<p>Rose hesitated slightly. “Several things;
her visit to the city for one.”</p>

<p>“I’ll warrant. Perhaps you found it interesting,
but when you have heard the same
story twenty-seven years, as I have, twenty-seven
years this winter, it will get to be a
weariness of the flesh; that and her lovers.”
She shot a keen glance at Rose, who could not
help a giggle.</p>

<p>Miss Jane Fifield shook the flour from her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
hands with energy. “I used to hope that
Eudora would grow sensible sometime, but
I’ve about given it up. One thing I am
thankful for, that there is something inside
of my head, and not all put on the outside!”
and she shut the oven door with a force that
threatened danger to the lightness of the
pound cake she was baking.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br>
<span class="fs80">UNDER A CLOUD</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Rose had been a few weeks at the Fifields,
long enough to learn the family ways, so that
Miss Fifield felt she could leave home for a
long-planned visit. It was a stormy day,
and Mrs. Patience suddenly exclaimed, “I
wonder who can be coming this way in such
a hurry? Why, I believe—yes, it is Rose,
running as fast as she can. I hope Eudora
is not sick.”</p>

<p>Almost as she spoke the door opened and
Rose rushed in, snow-powdered and breathless;
her hat blown partly off, her face wet
with tears as well as snow flakes, and her
voice broken and thick with sobs, as without
giving time for any questions she burst out:</p>

<p>“You said it was a leading of Providence
for me to go to the Fifields’. But it wasn’t;
and he says he will have me put in jail if I
don’t tell where the money is. And <em>how</em>
can I tell when I don’t know? Maybe God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
cares for some folks, but I’m sure He doesn’t
for me or I wouldn’t have so much trouble. I
wish I was dead, I do!” and flinging herself
down on the well-worn lounge she buried her
face in the pillow and burst into a storm of
sobs.</p>

<p>What did it all mean? They were equally
perplexed by the mystery and distressed by
Rose’s evident grief. Mrs. Patience drew off
her things and tried to calm her with soothing
words; Miss Silence brought the camphor
bottle—her remedy for all ills. But
Rose only cried the harder till Mrs. Blossom
kindly, but with the authority that comes
of a calm and self-controlled nature, said,
“Rose, you <em>must</em> stop crying, and tell us
what is the trouble.”</p>

<p>Then choking back her sobs Rose lifted her
tear-swollen face and exclaimed, “Oh, Mrs.
Blossom, Mr. Fifield says I have taken a hundred
dollars! A hundred dollars in gold!
And I don’t know one thing more about it
than you do, but he won’t believe me, and he
calls me a thief, and everybody will think I
am awful, when I want to be good, and was
trying so hard to do my best. What shall I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
do?” and she wrung her hands with a gesture
of utter despair.</p>

<p>Further questioning at last brought a connected
story, from which it appeared that
Nathan Fifield had a hundred dollars in gold,
that from some whim he had put for safe
keeping in the parlor stove. That morning,
going around the house to tie up a loose vine,
he had glanced through the parlor window
and seen Rose at the stove with the door
open. And when, his suspicion aroused, he
had looked for the money it had been to find
it gone, and at once had accused Rose of the
theft.</p>

<p>“And he says I showed guilt when I saw
him,” Rose wailed, “and I did start, for I
was frightened to see a face looking in at the
window, and with the snow on the glass I
didn’t know at first who it was.”</p>

<p>“But what were you in the parlor, and at
the stove for?” questioned Mrs. Blossom.</p>

<p>“I was dusting the front hall and the parlor.
Miss Fifield sweeps the parlor once a
month and I dust it every week, though I
don’t see the need, for those are all the times
anybody ever goes into it. Some feathers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
came out of the duster, it’s old and does shed
feathers, and I had opened the stove door to
throw them in. I didn’t know there was ever
any money in a little leather bag in there; I
never dreamed of such a thing. And if I had
I shouldn’t have touched it. Madam Sharpe
always trusted me with her purse, and I
never took a penny from her. I’m not a
thief, if he does say that I am. But they
won’t believe me. Miss Eudora is just as
certain, and I shall have to go to jail, for I
can’t tell where the money is.”</p>

<p>“Poor child!” and Grandmother Sweet
stroked the head that had gone down in Mrs.
Patience’s lap. “It is borne on my mind,”
and she glanced around the little group, “that
Rose is wholly innocent, and that mindful of
her youth and inexperience it were well for
some of us to see Neighbor Fifield if an explanation
of the mystery cannot be found.</p>

<p>“No,” with a wave of her hand, as both of
her granddaughters made a motion to rise,
“Silence, thee is apt to be hasty and might
say more than was seemly; and Patience,
thee inclines to be timid, and might not say
as much as was needful. Thy mother is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
one to go; she has both prudence and courage.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how good you are to me!” Rose exclaimed.
“And never so good as now! I
thought you would believe me, I just felt it
would kill me if you didn’t, and now that I
know you do I won’t be afraid of anything.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Blossom was already wrapping herself
in her cloak. “Come, Rose, put on your
things; the sooner this is sifted the better,”
and Rose, as many another had done before
her, felt a new comfort and strength in Mrs.
Blossom’s strength.</p>

<p>They found Mr. Fifield and his sister
hardly less excited than Rose. “You cannot
regret, Mrs. Blossom, any more than I
do, this most distressing occurrence,” and
Mr. Nathan rubbed his flushed bald head with
his red silk handkerchief. “I would rather
have given the money twice over than have
had it happen. But I must say that it is no
more than I expected when my sisters persisted,
against my judgment, in bringing into
the house a girl of whose ancestors they knew
nothing, and who most likely is the child of
some of the foreign paupers who are flooding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
our shores. I’m sorry, though not surprised,
that it has ended as it has.”</p>

<p>Mr. Nathan was really troubled and sorry,
as he said, but he could not help a spark of
self-satisfaction that he had been proven in
the right and his sisters in the wrong. As
for Miss Eudora, keenly mortified at the turn
matters had taken, her former friendliness to
Rose only increased her present indignation.</p>

<p>“It’s not only the loss of the money,” she
exclaimed, “but the ingratitude of it, after
all our kindness to her, and I gave her my
pink muffler; she never could have done what
she has if she had not been really hardened.”</p>

<p>“But what proof have you that she took the
money?” asked Mrs. Blossom. “As you
say she is a stranger to us all, a friendless,
homeless orphan, whose condition is a claim
to our charity as well as our generosity.”</p>

<p>“Proof,” echoed Mr. Nathan. “Pretty
plain proof I should call it, and I’ve served
three terms as Justice of the Peace. Last
Saturday the money was safe in its place of
concealment. This morning I surprised her
there and her confusion on discovery was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
almost evidence enough of itself. When I
look for the package it is gone, and during
this time not a soul outside the immediate
family has been in the house. I regret the
fact, but every circumstance points to her as
the guilty one.”</p>

<p>“For all that,” Mrs. Blossom’s voice was
calmly even, “I believe there is some mistake.
At the Refuge they told Patience they
had always found her truthful and honest,
and while she was with us we never saw anything
to make us doubt that she was perfectly
trusty. I did not even know of her
meddling with what she ought not to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s a sly one,” and Mr. Nathan
rubbed his head harder than before. “She
has taken us all in—and that includes myself,
and inclines me still more to the belief that
this is not her first offence; and also to the
opinion that she should be promptly dealt
with.”</p>

<p>“At the same time I hope,” urged Mrs.
Blossom, “that you will do nothing hastily.
Imprisonment is a terrible thing for a young
girl like Rose, and might blast her whole
life. Time makes many things clear, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
is always better to err on the side of mercy
than of justice.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, certainly. And I do not
know,” lowering his voice so it might not
reach Rose, “that I should really send her
to jail; but the law—” and he waved his
hand with his most magisterial air, “the law
must be a terror to evil-doers. If not, what
is law good for? We might as well not have
any, and my social as well as my official position
demands that I enforce it.”</p>

<p>“And she deserves to be well punished,
if ever any one did.” Miss Eudora gave an
indignant shake to her curls as she spoke.
“And I was just thinking of giving her the
blue cashmere I had when I went to Albany.
Jane is always complaining of what she calls
my ‘shilly-shally’ ways, and finding fault
with my lack of decision, and I feel that at
whatever cost to myself I must be firm in
this. Though nobody knows what a shock it
has been to my nerves.”</p>

<p>“Besides,” triumphantly added Mr. Nathan
Fifield, who felt that he was on the defensive
before Mrs. Blossom, and holding up
as he spoke an old-fashioned, richly chased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
gold locket, “here is further evidence.
While Rose was gone Eudora made an examination
of her effects and this is what she
found concealed in a pincushion. Now I
leave it to you if it looks reasonable that a
child in her position would have a valuable
trinket like that; or if she had, would keep it
hidden?”</p>

<p>When they entered the house Mrs. Blossom
had told Rose to stay in another room,
but through the partly opened door she
caught a glimpse of the locket as it swung
from Mr. Nathan’s fingers.</p>

<p>“That is mine!” she cried, darting in.
“My very own, and it was my mother’s.
What right have you with it, I should like to
know? And why isn’t it stealing for you to
go and take my things?”</p>

<p>“Hush, Rose!” Mrs. Blossom reproved.
And then her faith in Rose a little shaken
in spite of herself, “If the locket is yours,
as you say, why did you never tell us about
it? And why did you hide it so?”</p>

<p>“Why, I never once thought of it,” she
answered, looking frankly up at Mrs. Blossom.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
“I don’t think the locket is pretty at
all, it is so queer and old-fashioned, and I
don’t even know whose picture is inside. All
the reason I care for it is because it was my
mother’s. And I sewed it up in that pincushion,
which one of the teachers at the
Refuge gave me, because I was afraid if Mrs.
Hagood saw the locket she might take it
away from me.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if this could have been her
mother’s father,” for Mrs. Blossom’s mind
at once turned to the subject she had thought
of so often—that of Rose’s family.</p>

<p>“There was a chain to the locket once, but
I broke and lost that. I remember that
mamma used sometimes to let me wear it, and
it seems to me she said it was Uncle Samuel’s
picture, but I’m not sure.”</p>

<p>“It certainly is a good face.” And Mrs.
Blossom held out the open locket to Miss
Eudora, who as she took it let it drop from
her fingers that the unwonted excitement had
made tremulous. In striking the floor a
spring was pressed to a compartment behind
the picture, and as Mr. Nathan Fifield<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
stooped to pick it up a piece of closely folded
paper fell out.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blossom hastily spread this out, and
found it the marriage certificate of Kate Jarvis
and James Shannon, dated at Fredonia,
N. Y., some sixteen years before. “Here is
a clue to Rose’s family,” she exclaimed, as
they all clustered about the bit of time-yellowed
paper, forgetting for the moment the
cloud that rested so heavily over Rose.</p>

<p>“It surely should be,” responded Mr. Nathan.</p>

<p>“I shall write to Fredonia at once,” continued
Mrs. Blossom. “And as the minister
whose name is signed may in the meantime
have died or moved away, my best course
would be to write first to the postmaster for
information, would it not?”</p>
<br>

“<span class="smcap">Here is a clue to Rose’s family.</span>”—<em>Page <a href="#Page_216">216</a>.</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>“That is what I should advise.” Squire
Nathan was never so happy as when giving
advice. “It might be well to inclose a letter
to the minister, and also a copy of the marriage
certificate. If Rose has any relatives
living she ought to trace them by this.
Though whether she is likely to prove any
credit to her family or not is doubtful,” he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>added, recalling with a frown the fact that
she was a suspected criminal.</p>

<p>“I have faith in her that she will.” Mrs.
Blossom’s tone was decided. “And if you
are willing to let matters rest for the present
I will, if you have no objections, take Rose
home with me.”</p>

<p>“I shall be only too glad to have you, for
my part.” Miss Eudora’s tone was fervent.
“After what has happened I don’t feel that
I could endure her in the house another day.”</p>

<p>“And of course I shall consider you responsible
for her safekeeping,” added Mr.
Nathan. “She admits that she ran away
once; she may do so again.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t, you need not be afraid.”
Rose’s voice was trembling, but she held it
firm.</p>

<p>“For you understand,” with emphasis,
“that I am not dropping the matter of the
missing money, but only, at your request,
passing it over for the present. I will repeat,
however, that if Rose will confess and
return the money, no one but ourselves shall
ever know of it. If she does not I shall feel
myself constrained, much as I may regret the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
necessity, to resort to more severe measures,”
and he blew his nose with a great
flourish of his red silk handkerchief by way
of emphasis.</p>

</div>

<p>So absorbed was Rose in her trouble that
she took little or no interest in the attempt
to discover her family, or the discussions
that took place in the Blossom household as
to its probable result. “I don’t believe I have
any relatives,” she said indifferently, “or
they would have looked after me when my
mother and father died. And even if I have
they wouldn’t want to own any one accused
of stealing.”</p>

<p>That was the burden of all her thoughts;
she woke in the morning to a sense of overwhelming
calamity, and went to sleep at night
with its pressure heavy on her heart. When
Grandmother Sweet had mildly questioned if
in the discovery of the marriage certificate
she did not see the hand of Providence, she
had replied, with the irritability of suffering,
that she didn’t believe in Providence at all.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
“I might,” she had added, “if that money
could be found; I sha’n’t till then.”</p>

<p>For to Rose the executioner’s sword had
not been lifted, only stayed for the time.
Visions of arrest and imprisonment were
constantly before her, all the more terrifying
that the vagueness of her knowledge as
to their realities left ample room for her imagination.
“<em>How</em> can I tell where the money
is when I don’t know?” was the question she
repeated over and over. “And you know
what he said he would do if I didn’t tell?”</p>

<p>She refused to go to school for fear her
schoolmates had heard of her disgrace. She
cried till she was nearly blind, and fretted
herself into a fever, till Mrs. Blossom, fearing
she would make herself really sick, talked
to her seriously on the selfishness as well as
the harm of self-indulgence, even in grief,
and the duty as well as the need of self-control.</p>

<p>Rose had never thought of her conduct in
that light before, and left alone she lay for a
long time, now thoroughly aroused from her
morbid self-absorption, and looking herself,
as it were, fully in the face. The fire crackled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
cheerily in the little stove, the sunshine came
in at the window of the pleasant, low chamber,
on the stand by her bed were a cup of
sage tea Grandmother Sweet had made for
her, a glass of aconite Mrs. Patience had
prepared, and a dainty china bowl of lemon
jelly Miss Silence had brought to tempt if
possible her appetite. Mute evidence, each
and all of kindly affection, that touched Rose
and filled her with a sense of shame that she
had made such poor return for all that had
been done for her.</p>

<p>Rising with a sudden impulse, she went to
the little glass, pushed back the tumbled hair
from her tear-swollen face, and sternly took
herself to task. “I’m ashamed of you, I am
indeed, that after you have been taken into
this home, and cared for, you should be so
ungrateful as to make every one in it uncomfortable
now, because you happen to be in
trouble; and should have shown yourself as
disagreeable, and selfish, and thoughtless as
you have. Not one of them would have done
so, you may be sure; and if you ever expect
to grow into a woman that people will respect
and love as they do Grandmother Sweet, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
Mrs. Blossom, or Miss Silence, or Mrs. Patience,
you <em>must</em> learn to control yourself.
And now, to begin, you must brush your hair,
bathe your eyes, go downstairs and do as you
ought to do. I know it will be pretty hard,
but you <em>must</em> do it.”</p>

<p>It was hard. With a morbid self-consciousness
that every one could not but know
of her trouble she had hidden, shrinking from
the village folk who so often came in; she
was so weak that as she crossed the room
she had to put her hand against the wall to
steady her steps; and now that she was making
the effort to rouse herself she began to
see the luxury it had been to be perfectly
wretched. But Rose resisted the temptation
to throw herself again on the bed; she crept
steadily, if somewhat weakly, downstairs,
and made a brave attempt at smiling. With
a guilty sense of all the opportunities for
making herself useful she had neglected, she
took up a stitch in her knitting Grandmother
Sweet had dropped; overcast some velvet
for Mrs. Patience, who was in a hurry with a
bonnet; and that done helped Miss Silence
set the table and make supper ready.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>They all saw the struggle Rose was making
and helped her by keeping her mind as
much as possible off from herself. And
though that missing money still hung its dark
shadow over her, and she started at every
step outside with the sinking fear that it
might be some one coming to arrest her, when
she went to her room that night Grandmother
Sweet patted her cheek as she kissed her
good-night and whispered, “Thee has done
bravely, Rose,” an unspoken approval she
read in the manner of the others. More than
that, she was surprised to find her heart
lighter than she would have thought possible
a few hours before.</p>

<p>To keep steadily on in the way she had
marked out for herself was anything but easy
during those days of suspense and anxiety.
To hold back the lump that was always
threatening to rise in her throat, the tears
from springing to her eyes; to keep a cheerful
face when her heart would be sinking
down, down; to feel an interest in the concerns
of others when her own seemed to swallow
up everything else. But it was her first
step in a habit of conscious self-discipline that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
she never forgot, and that helped her to meet
many an after hour of trial.</p>

<p>So something over a week went by, for
though Mrs. Blossom had seen Mr. Nathan
Fifield several times the mystery was as much
of a mystery as the first day, and in spite of
all Mrs. Blossom could urge both he and Miss
Eudora seemed to grow the more bitter toward
Rose. Nor had there come any answer
to the letters of inquiry sent to Fredonia.
Every possible theory having been exhausted
in both cases, the subjects had come to be
avoided by a tacit consent. While as to the
matter of the marriage certificate, that had
made so little impression on Rose’s mind
that she was less disappointed than the others
in regard to it. Mrs. Blossom did not fail
to pray daily at family devotions that the
truth they were seeking might be revealed,
and innocence established, and she moved
around with the serene manner of one who
has given over all care to a higher power.
But though Rose was unconsciously sustained
by a reliance on that strong faith she
did not pray for herself. A hopeless apathy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
chilled her. There might be a God, it didn’t
matter much to her, for if there was she was
an alien to His love, and she knew she was
that for all the rest might say.</p>

<p>But one afternoon Rose saw a little procession—Mr.
Nathan Fifield and his two sisters,
in single file, crossing the now snow-covered
common in the direction of Mrs.
Blossom’s. All her fears revived at the
sight. She sprang up, her eyes dilated, her
face flushing and paling. “There they
come!” she cried. “I knew they would.
They are going to put me in prison, I know
they are! Oh, don’t let them take me away!
Don’t let them!” and she threw herself down
beside Miss Silence and hid her face in her
lap as if for safety.</p>

<p>Silence put her strong arms about the trembling
form. “Sit up, Rose,” she said in a
matter-of-fact tone, “and wait till you see
what there is to be afraid of.”</p>

<p>By the time Rose had struggled back to
outward calmness the visitors had entered;
Mr. Nathan, his face almost as red as the
red silk handkerchief he waved in his hand;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
Miss Eudora dissolved in tears; and Miss
Fifield with an expression of mingled vexation
and crestfallen humility.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s awkward silence,
broken by Mr. Nathan in an abrupt and aggravated
tone. “I’ve come to explain a mistake
I have been led into by women’s meddling
and—”</p>

<p>“You needn’t include me,” interrupted
Miss Eudora. “You know I wouldn’t have
said what I did if you hadn’t made me feel
that we were in danger of being murdered
in our beds, and I hadn’t thought Jane would
be always blaming me if I didn’t use decision.
Nobody can tell how painful it has been for
me to do what I have. I don’t know when
my nerves will recover from the strain, and
I’ve lost flesh till my dresses are so loose
they will hardly hang on me. I’m sure I
never dreamed that Jane—”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, lay all the blame you can on Jane,”
rejoined that lady grimly. “It isn’t often you
get the chance, so both of you make the best
of it. I’m sure when I went away I never
dreamed that you were going to get in a panic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
and act like a pair of lunatics, particularly
a strong-minded man like Nathan. I never
was so astonished as when I reached home
on the stage to-day and found out what had
happened. Eudora says she wrote me about
it, but if she did she must have forgotten to
put the State on; she always does, and the
letter may be making the round of the Romes
of the whole country; or else Nathan is carrying
it in his pocket yet—he never does remember
to mail a letter.”</p>

<p>“If I were you I wouldn’t say anything
about remembering, now or for some time to
come,” snapped her brother.</p>

<p>“Friends,” Grandmother Sweet’s voice
was serenely calm, “if thee will refrain from
thy bickering and explain what thee means,
it will be clear to our minds what doubtless
thee wishes us to know.”</p>

<p>While Rose, unable longer to restrain her
impatience, exclaimed, “Oh, tell us, have you
found who stole the money?”</p>

<p>“That is just what I want to do if I can
have a chance,” and Mr. Fifield glared at
Jane and Eudora. Then to Rose, “No, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
haven’t found who stole the money,” and as
her face paled he hastened to add, “because,
in fact, the money was not stolen at all.”</p>

<p>“Where—what—” cried his eager listeners,
while Rose drew a long breath of infinite
relief and sank back in her chair trembling,
almost faint with the joyful relaxation after
the long strain of anxiety.</p>

<p>“Jane,” Mr. Nathan continued, rubbing
his head till every hair stood up, “simply
saw fit to remove the money from the place
where she knew I was in the habit of keeping
it, without even letting me know what she had
done.”</p>

<p>“You see,” explained Miss Fifield, feeling
herself placed on the defensive and determined
to maintain it boldly, “I had just read
of a man who kept his money in a stove, and
one day some one built a fire and burned it
all up, so I felt a stove was not a very safe
hiding-place.”</p>

<p>“Well,” snorted Mr. Nathan, “as there
hasn’t to my certain knowledge been a fire in
that parlor stove for the last four years, I
don’t think there was much danger, to say
nothing of the fact that gold will not burn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>“But it will melt,” triumphantly. “Besides,
I have been told that when burglars go
into a house under carpets and in stoves are
among the first places they look. For these
reasons I changed it to a trunk under a pile
of papers in the store-room. I intended to
have told Nathan what I had done, but in the
hurry of getting away I did forget. But I
should have thought that before accusing any
one they would have waited to see what I
knew about the matter.”</p>

<p>“You say so much about my being forgetful
that I didn’t suppose you ever did such a
thing as to forget,” growled Mr. Nathan.
And Eudora added, “And her mind’s always
on what she is doing. She has so little patience
with mistakes I never thought of her
being the one to blame.”</p>

<p>“At any rate,” retorted Miss Fifield, “I
don’t lose my glasses a dozen times a day.
And I don’t put things in the oven to bake
and get to mooning and let them burn up. I
admit I was in fault about this, and I am as
sorry as I can be for the trouble it has made,
and most of all for the unjust suspicion it
has brought on Rose; but, fortunately, no one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
but ourselves is aware of this, and I don’t
know as it will make matters any better to
harp on it forever.”</p>

<p>In fact, it needed no words to tell that the
Fifields were not only heartily sorry for what
had happened, but decidedly ashamed. For
every one had been touched in the way to be
felt most keenly; Squire Fifield in that he
had been proven unjust and mistaken in his
opinion, Miss Eudora that she had been hard-hearted,
and Miss Fifield that she had failed
in memory and laid herself open to blame.
This blow at the especial pride of each, made
them, while really glad that Rose had been
proved innocent, for the moment almost wish
that she or some one could at least have been
guilty enough to have saved them the present
irritation of chagrin and humiliation.</p>

<p>Perhaps unconsciously something of this
showed itself in Mr. Nathan’s manner as he
said: “Yes, Rose, we deeply regret that we
have wrongfully accused you—though I must
still say that under the circumstances we
seemed justified in doing so, and I hope you
will accept this as a compensation for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
trouble it has made you,” and he dropped
a couple of gold eagles in her lap.</p>

<p>Rose’s cheeks crimsoned. “I don’t want
any such money,” she cried hotly, flinging
the gold coins to the floor. “Because I was
poor and hadn’t any home or friends you
thought I must be a liar and a thief. If you
had said as though you’d meant it that you
were sorry for the way you had treated me it
would have been all I asked. I don’t ask
to be paid for being honest. It’s an insult
for you to offer to, and I’d beg before I’d
touch it, I would!”</p>

<p>“Rose, Rose!” reproved Mrs. Blossom,
who had been unable to check the indignant
torrent. “I trust you will overlook the way
Rose has spoken,” she hastened to say.
“This last week has been a great strain on
her, and her nerves are in a condition that
she is hardly responsible.” As she spoke
she gave a warning glance at Silence, from
the expression of whose face she knew that
she approved of Rose’s action, and was fearful
would endorse it in words; at the same
time Mrs. Patience looked at Rose in amazement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
that she should dare thus to provoke
Nathan Fifield’s well-known irascible temper,
and all present waited for the explosion
they expected would follow.</p>

<p>But contrary to their expectation after a
moment’s amazement he began to laugh.
“She’ll do,” he said to Mrs. Blossom with a
nod of approval. “Grit like that will pull
through every time, and she’s got it about
right, too. Upon my word,” rubbing his
hands as if at a sudden idea, “if no one else
puts in a claim I will be tempted to adopt
her myself. I believe an education wouldn’t
be wasted, and with her spunk I’d like to see
what she would make.”</p>

<p>One good thing about Rose’s temper was
that though fiery its flame was quickly spent,
and penitence was almost sure to swiftly
follow wrath. It was so in this case; hardly
had he ceased speaking when a meek little
voice was heard, “I didn’t do right at all,
Mr. Fifield, to talk to you as I did, and I hope
you’ll forgive me?”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear,” was the answer, “I
didn’t do right either in being so ready to
think evil of you, in being on the lookout for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
something wrong, as I was, and I hope you’ll
forgive me?”</p>

<p>“And me, too,” sobbed Miss Eudora. “I
never was hard on anybody before in my
life, and I’m sure I never will be again.”</p>

<p>“And now,” observed Miss Fifield drily,
“I suppose I ought to ask to be forgiven for
being the guilty one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Fifield,” and Rose caught her
hand, “we all forget things; I know I tried
you lots of times by forgetting. It wasn’t—I
suppose—strange they should have thought
as they did, but it’s all right now. And
please promise me, Mr. Fifield and Miss Eudora,
that you will let it all go, and never
say anything unpleasant to Miss Fifield
about it.”</p>

<p>“Why, child!” cried Mr. Nathan, as if
astonished at the idea, “I wouldn’t say anything
unpleasant to my sisters, I never do.
Of course I have to hold them level now and
then, but I don’t know as I ever spoke a really
unpleasant word to them in my life.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Miss Fifield’s tone was complacent,
“that is one of the things I have always
been thankful for, that we were a perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
harmonious family. I don’t deny that I am
tried sometimes with Nathan and Eudora,
but I never let them know it.”</p>

<p>“I have my trials, too,” added Miss Eudora
with a pensive shake of her little grey
curls, “but I bear them in silence. Family
squabbles are so disgraceful that I don’t see
how a person of refinement could ever take
part in one.”</p>

<p>Rose stared round-eyed from one to another
speaker, and Silence Blossom turned
her face away for a moment; but Grandmother
Sweet smiled gently, for she had long
ago learned how seldom it is that people know
their own faults, or see themselves as others
see them.</p>

<p>As they were leaving Miss Fifield turned
to Rose. “Of course we shall want you to
come back to us. When will that be?”</p>

<p>“Not just at present,” Mrs. Blossom
hastened to answer. “First of all she must
have time to rest and get back to her usual
self.” Rose lifted grateful eyes, for at that
moment it didn’t seem to her that she could
enter the Fifield house again.</p>

<p>At the door Miss Eudora paused. “And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
you haven’t heard anything yet about her
people? Finding the marriage certificate in
the locket was just like a story. And if she
should prove to be an heiress how romantic
that would be! I heard of such a case the
winter I was in Albany.”</p>

</div>

<p>Surprising events were not over for Rose.
The next morning as she was dusting the
sitting-room, with a lighter heart than she had
thought could ever again be hers, a carriage
drew up at the small white gate, from which
an old gentleman alighted and came nimbly
along the narrow, flagged walk, tapping the
stones smartly with his gold-headed cane.</p>

<p>“Is this Mrs. Blossom?” he asked in a
thin, brisk voice as she answered his knock
on the green-paneled door, where Rose had
stood with fluttering heart so few months
before. “Then I suppose you are the person
who wrote concerning a young girl supposed
to be the daughter of Kate Jarvis and
James Shannon.”</p>

<p>At that moment he caught sight of Rose.
“Bless my heart!” he exclaimed, stepping
in. “If there isn’t the child now! Kate’s
own daughter; I’d have known her anywhere.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
The very picture of what her mother was at
her age. Bless me!” and he rubbed his thin
face, flushed with the chill of the ride from
Byfield and wrinkled like a withered apple,
with a great white silk handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Turn around to the light, child,” he directed
Rose, not heeding Mrs. Blossom’s invitation
to lay aside his wraps. “I want to
get a good look at you. Yes,” lifting her
chin and moving her head from side to side,
“clear Jarvis and no mistake—the color of
the hair and eyes, the turn of the head and
all. I’m thankful you’re no Shannon,
though Jim looked well enough as far as that
went.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear,” to Mrs. Blossom, “to think
that Brother Robert’s daughter, the little
Kate I have held on my knee many a time,
should be grown and married and dead, and
this be her child. It’s difficult, madam, to
realize such changes; it makes one feel that
he is growing old, upon my word it does.”</p>

<p>Rose, on her part, was looking at him intently.
“I believe it is your picture in the
locket,” and running upstairs she quickly
returned with it open in her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>He drew out his eye-glasses. “Yes, that
is my picture. Quite a good-looking fellow
I was in those days. Kate was my only
niece, and I gave her the locket on her eighteenth
birthday. And so she always kept it,
and you have it still. Well, well!”</p>

<p>“And had my mother an Aunt Sarah?”
questioned Rose.</p>

<p>“Yes, her mother’s only sister, Sarah
Hartly.”</p>

<p>“I have a Bible she gave my mother, with
‘To Kate from Aunt Sarah,’ written inside.”</p>

<p>“Well,” with a little chuckle, “I’m surprised
to know that she ever gave anybody
anything.”</p>
<br>

“<span class="smcap">Clear Jarvis and no mistake.</span>”—<em>Page <a href="#Page_237">237</a>.</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>“I haven’t thanked you yet,” and he turned
again to Mrs. Blossom, “for the interest you
have shown in the matter. Indeed I was
so surprised when I received the letter from
the minister who married Kate, who still
lives in Fredonia, inclosing yours to him,
and the first word concerning Kate for fifteen
years, that I haven’t recovered from it yet.
And now to find another Kate, as you may
say; why, it makes me feel as though I had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>lost my reckoning, and the world had rolled
back thirty years.”</p>

<p>“And did you not know then that Rose’s
mother was dead?”</p>

<p>“No. Since her foolish, runaway marriage
to Jim Shannon, sixteen years ago, I had
not heard a word either from or about her,
till your letter, and you know how little that
told. Since her mother’s death the lawyer
in charge of the business has made every
effort to find a trace of Kate or her heirs,
but in vain. Of the events of her later life
I know nothing whatever, not even when or
where she died.”</p>

<p>“It was when I was quite a little girl,” answered
Rose, “and in a city that I now think
was Chicago.”</p>

<p>“I gather from Mrs. Blossom’s letter that
your father was also dead. Is that so?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he died a little while after mamma.”</p>

<p>“A fortunate circumstance for you,” with
a nod to Mrs. Blossom. “And where have
you been all this time; and why if you had
your mother’s marriage certificate didn’t
you try to find your friends, or somebody
before this try to find them for you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>In the meantime, Mr. Samuel Jarvis, the
old gentleman, as he talked, had by degrees
taken off his muffler, fur-lined overcoat, fur
cap and gloves, and accepted the comfortable
rocker before the fire. Now in answer to
his question, made though it was in a somewhat
testy fashion, Rose related to him her
story, recalling all the details she could remember
of her mother, while Great-Uncle
Samuel rubbed his eyes with his big silk
handkerchief and murmured, “Poor Kate,
poor Kate!”</p>

<p>When she came to her residence with
Madam Atheldena Sharpe, his tone changed
to one of horrified protest. “Kate’s baby
in the hands of a travelling clairvoyant; exhibited
like a Punch and Judy Show; who
ever heard of such a thing!” As she told
of the exposure, and her desertion by Madam
Sharpe, the bitterness and misery of which
she had never forgotten, he bristled with indignation.
“Kate’s baby with nowhere to
go and nothing to eat; alone, afraid, and
hungry! Could it be possible!”</p>

<p>All excited as she was, and stimulated still
more by his interest, Rose gave to her story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
a certain dramatic force. Her keen sense
of the ludicrous gave some humorous touches
even to her description of Mrs. Hagood.
When it came to her trouble with that lady
she hesitated a moment, and then gave a
most dramatic account of the closing scene,
as well as of her flight, her encounter with
Ben Pancost, and the help he had given her.</p>

<p>“True Jarvis spirit!” cried Great-Uncle
Samuel, rubbing his hands. “Kate’s baby
climbed out of the window in the night;
tramped off all alone. Just think of it!
And that boy, I’d like to meet him!”</p>

<p>But when she came to tell of her appearance
at the Blossom home, and the kindness
which she had there received, he insisted on
shaking hands with the whole family in turn.
“Bless me,” he exclaimed, “to think you
have done all this for Kate’s baby. Who
ever heard anything like it?”</p>

<p>Her stay at the Fifields’, including as it
did the accusation made against her there,
was a subject so fresh and painful to Rose,
and seemed to her from the fact of the suspicion
to involve her in such a disgrace that
when she came to it she flushed, hesitated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
and Mrs. Blossom, seeing her embarrassment,
came to the rescue and related the
circumstances that had led to the bringing
out of the locket, and the accidental discovery
of the marriage certificate inside it.</p>

<p>To Rose’s great surprise Great-Uncle Samuel
did not seem to regard the fact that she
had been charged with theft as anything particularly
shameful; indeed he treated it with
decided indifference. “They need not have
worried,” with a lofty tone, “as to her being
a low-bred child, the Jarvises are as good
blood as you will often find. And to think,”
sadly, “that the locket I gave Kate should
have served a purpose neither of us ever
dreamed of.”</p>

<p>“And why was it you didn’t know anything
about my mother?” asked Rose.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Blossom, “that is a
question I was just going to ask.”</p>

<p>“As I said before, when she ran away
with Jim Shannon she cut herself off from
all her friends. Poor Kate, how much suffering
she brought on herself by her wilfulness!
And yet I don’t think the blame was
all hers. If her father had lived I’m certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
it would never have happened; but her
mother was a woman who wanted to bend
every one and everything to her will. And
Kate was an uncommonly high-spirited girl,
impulsive and a trifle headstrong, but generous,
affectionate, and everybody’s favorite;
a girl that it needed some tact to manage,
and her mother hadn’t a particle of tact.
So when Kate fell in love with Jim Shannon
she made a bad matter worse instead of
better. Enough was said to Kate but she
wouldn’t believe a word of it. I told her
myself that he drank like a fish, and she
only held up her head and said that he might
have been a trifle wild, as any number of
other young men had been, but that he was
going to be entirely different. Well, it was
the old story, marry him she would and did.
And when she wrote to her mother asking
if she could come home, Mary sent word
back that she might, but her husband could
never cross her threshold. Of course that
made Jim mad, and Kate wrote at once that
whoever received her must receive her husband
also. Her mother sent that letter back
to her, and there it all ended. In less than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
a week they were on their way West, and
Kate never wrote a word home again.</p>

<p>“Some of her girl friends had a few letters
from her, very bright at first, and telling
how happy she was in her new home, but
these soon stopped. I don’t deny that I was a
good deal put out with her at first, but I
understood her silence only too well. If life
had gone smoothly with her she would have
written, but as it was, she knew that whatever
she had to endure she had brought it
on herself, and she would bear it alone.</p>

<p>“Kate’s mother was a proud woman, too.
From the day Kate left she never mentioned
her name, nor would she let any one mention
it to her; but I believe that secretly she
lived in the expectation and hope of her return.
It was like her when she died, five
years ago, not to leave any will, and the
lawyer has advertised, and tried in every
way to find some trace of Kate. And now,
like the spring in the locket, all at once unexpectedly
it opens and everything is clear
and plain.”</p>

<p>He turned abruptly to Rose, who had been
listening intently to all that concerned her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
mother. “What did they say your name
was, Rose? I ought to remember that, when
I was a little boy in school if there was a
little girl we liked very much we used to
write on a slate,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry fs80">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘The rose is red,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The violet blue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Sugar is sweet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And so are you,’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">and hold it up for her to see. Now, Rose,
when I speak of the property your grandmother
has left you may think you are going
to be an heiress. And I want to tell you
the first thing that you will be nothing of
the kind. My brother left everything to his
wife, and she had no more business sense
than that cat, so when she died there was
very little left. I don’t know the exact
amount but somewhere about three thousand
dollars. The proofs are sufficient that you
are Kate’s child, so there will be no trouble
there. But you understand that there isn’t
enough for you to go to seaside summer resorts,
or to fly very high in the fashionable
world.”</p>

<p>Rose laughed outright. “Why, I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
know anything about either seaside summer
resorts, or the fashionable world, and never
expect to.”</p>

<p>“Just as well; it’s a pity more women,
young and old, can’t say the same. But as
I was going to say, if you are willing to use
strict economy there will be enough to take
care of you at least till you are through
school.”</p>

<p>Rose’s eyes sparkled with joy. “Oh, if
there is only enough for that it is all I ask!
Once I have education to teach I can take
care of myself.”</p>

<p>“That sounds like Kate. And if you are
like her as much as you look I sha’n’t fear
for you.”</p>

<span class="fs80">ROSE FINDS A RESTING-PLACE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Or course, Mr. Jarvis, you will stay with
us to dinner, and as much longer as you can,”
said Miss Silence as he drew out a big gold
watch and snapped the case open.</p>

<p>“Thank you, madam, thank you. I shall
be glad to accept your hospitality for the dinner.
In the meantime I think I will take a
walk about your pleasant little village. By
the way, there are two questions I always ask
concerning a place: what is its latitude, and
population?” and he looked from one to another.</p>

<p>Miss Silence laughed. “I am afraid we
can answer neither question.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter, I can judge of the latter
myself.” And having enveloped himself
again in his muffler, overcoat, cap, and gloves,
he went briskly down the walk, his cane seeming
more for ornament than need.</p>

<p>Rose hurried out into the kitchen and putting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
on her gingham apron began to set the
table. “I suppose now,” and Silence counted
out the eggs to fry with the ham, “that I
sha’n’t have you to help me much longer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Silence,” and dropping the
bread tray, Rose caught her around the waist
and gave her a squeeze, “you know, you
know, I never will go away from here as long
as I may stay.”</p>

<p>For Rose had been tossed to and fro like a
shuttlecock at the mercy of adverse currents
so long, that she felt not only some wonder
but a little uneasiness as to what disposal
would next be made of her.</p>

<p>“It’s very nice, of course,” as she sliced
the bread, “when I didn’t know that I had a
relative to have Great-Uncle Samuel walk in,
and I suppose he has the right to say where I
shall go, and what I shall do. Only I’m so
tired of changes and uncertainties that I wish
I might never have to make another change;
and I wish that I might know right now, right
away, what I am going to do.”</p>

<p>As for Mr. Samuel Jarvis, the surprising
news of Rose’s existence, followed so quickly
by her appearance before him in the flesh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
was of itself bewildering, to say nothing of
the responsibility so suddenly thrust upon
him of making provision for her future.</p>

<p>This was shown by a certain preoccupation
of manner on his return. Not so much so
but that his eyes, still keen and bright, noted
everything around him; the well-appointed
table, the delicately served food, the low tones
and gentle manners of the group surrounding
it, the air of order and comfort pervading
the modest home. But it was not till he
pushed back from the table after the meal
that he mentioned the question of vital interest
to Rose.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking,” he spoke to Mrs.
Blossom, tapping his cane on the floor as he
talked, “what I ought to do for Kate’s baby
now I’ve found her, and I don’t know when
I’ve come across a harder proposition. I
don’t wonder that women look worn out who
have half a dozen girls to provide for. I’m
sure that one would be too much for me.</p>

<p>“Of course Sarah Hartly is the one who
ought to take Violet—oh, Rose, so it is, and
if she wasn’t so supremely selfish she would.
I stopped off at Fredonia, on my way from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
Buffalo here, and put it up to her. There she
is, her grandmother’s sister, and Kate her
only niece, a widow without chick or child,
and a house she doesn’t begin to use, and she
said her health wasn’t good enough, and her
nerves were too weak to take a bouncing girl—those
were her very words, ‘bouncing girl,’
into her family. I should think her nerves
would be weak,” he sniffed, “with that
miserable whiffet dog she keeps, barking and
snapping at every one. Snapped at me he
did, and I told Sarah plainly that if a dog
ever bit me some one would pay well for it.
She shut him up then, and he was howling
and scratching when I came away.</p>

<p>“Now, I can’t take her. I never was married
and I don’t know any more what a girl
needs than the man in the moon. Besides, I
live at a club and that would be no place for
a young girl. But as I was saying about—what
did you say her name was? Oh, yes,
Rose, she looks strong and healthy, and I’d
like to have her stay where she could have
pure air, and new milk and fresh eggs.
There is no place like the country to live, at
least when one is young.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>“I’m quite pleased with your little village;
it’s situated nicely, and your town-folk tell
me you have no malaria. I have made inquiry
about the school and am told it is unusually
good for a place of this size. And,
Mrs. Blossom, I had just as soon tell you that
I have made inquiries about your family, with
the most flattering answers. You have all
shown the kindest interest in the poor child,
and from what I have heard, and still more
from what I have seen, I feel that if she can
remain in your care it will be the best arrangement
I could make for her. Would
that suit you?” turning to Rose.</p>

<p>“Indeed it would,” her face bright with
pleasure that what she had wished seemed
so near fulfilment. “Nothing could suit me
better.”</p>

<p>“Wait a moment,” waving his hand to
Mrs. Blossom not to speak; “I want to make
myself fully understood. If Kate’s baby remains
here you will, of course, be paid for her
board, but I should want you to regard her
as more than a mere boarder—in short, to receive
her as one of your family, and give her
the same care and interest, and as long as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
arrangement continues that this shall be her
home, and all that implies.”</p>

<p>As Rose glanced from one to another she
recalled the day when homeless and friendless
she had sat in that same room and waited,
with a hungry hope in her heart, for the decision
that meant so much to her; the misery
and uncertainty of further wandering, or the
happiness and security of a shelter and abiding-place.
There had been a great change
since then. Now she had Great-Uncle Samuel
to vouch for her; she was no longer an
unknown and half-suspected applicant for
charity, but ready and able to pay for what
she had. But so dear had that home, and
those within it grown to Rose, with such a
dread did she shrink from the thought of
being thrust out again among strangers that
not even on that first time, it seemed to her,
did she wait the answer more eagerly.</p>

<p>As often happened, impulsive Silence was
the first to speak. “For my part, I should
be only too glad to have Rose stay with us,
and I will do all I can to make her happy
here.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure,” it was Mrs. Patience’s gentle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
voice, “Rose has won for herself a place in
our home, that would be vacant without her.”</p>

<p>It was a moment longer before Mrs. Blossom
spoke, and when she did there was a
quiver in her usually firm, self-controlled
tone, “Yes, I will keep Rose, and I will do for
her just as I would have done for my own
little Rachel if she had lived.”</p>

<p>Grandmother Sweet, sitting in her rocker
with the sunshine falling across her snowy
hair and serene face, laid down her knitting,
whose subdued click, click, seemed like her
own quiet personality to pervade the room,
“I feel it borne on my mind, Elizabeth, that
thee will never regret the word thee has just
given.” And then to Mr. Jarvis, “Thee need
feel no concern for the child, for while Silence
and Patience in the tenderness of their
hearts would, I fear, wholly spoil her, their
mother will be heedful of her duty to guide
and train. And truly it will be a pleasure to
us all to have this little one of the dear Lord
set in our midst.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, madam,” and Great-Uncle
Samuel made a deferential bow to her; “I
shall go away with my mind at ease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>“And now,” to Rose, “if I leave you with
these kind ladies I shall expect you to be
good and obedient in return for all they do
for you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try to be,” was Rose’s dutiful answer.</p>

<p>“That’s right, that’s right. I hope you
always will remember to. Young people are
very apt to think they know it all when they
haven’t the first idea what’s for their good.
I’m glad you look like your mother, and hope
you will have all her good qualities, but I
want you to remember the trouble she brought
on herself and all who cared for her just by
wilfulness. I believe that settles everything.
Four dollars, I was told, is the average price
for board here; if that is satisfactory a check
will be sent you every three months, for that
and Rose’s expenses. But mind,” turning
to Rose, “you must be very prudent to make
the money last.”</p>

<p>She hesitated a little. “I—I could go back
to the Fifields’. They would pay me fifty
cents a week and that would save a good
deal.”</p>

<p>He threw up both hands. “What! Robert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
Jarvis’s granddaughter, Kate’s child, a servant?
Bless me! Never let me hear of that
again!”</p>

<p>“Rose is very helpful about the house,”
added Mrs. Blossom. “I will not ask that
price.”</p>

<p>“Little enough, madam, little enough. Besides,
I want you to teach her useful things;
to cook, to take care of a house. More men
are killed by bad bread than bullets, and I
don’t want Kate’s baby ever to murder any
one that way.” As he spoke he began to
draw on his overcoat.</p>

<p>“Why, you are not going?” exclaimed Mrs.
Blossom.</p>

<p>“Yes, madam, yes. There seems no need
for me to stay longer. The team that
brought me from the station is waiting to
take me back for the evening train, and I can
be in Buffalo again in the morning.”</p>

<p>“But when are you coming again, Uncle
Samuel?” asked Rose.</p>

<p>“Can’t say, Rose—yes, I am right, it is
Rose. What with dyspepsia and rheumatism,
and the weight of years, I am not a
great traveler. Besides, everything is, I believe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
satisfactorily settled. My brief stay
has been very pleasant,” as he shook hands
around, ending with Rose and the admonition,
“Be a credit to these good ladies.”</p>

<p>The team was already waiting at the gate.
“He doesn’t intend to come again,” said Rose
with a wistful accent as she stood at the window
and watched Great-Uncle Samuel tuck
the fur robes about him and drive away.</p>

<span class="fs80">PAYING DEBTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Rose stood at the window as long as Great-Uncle
Samuel was in sight. Then she turned
away and sitting down on a low stool by
Grandmother Sweet’s side laid her head on
its chintz covered arm.</p>

<p>“Grandma Sweet,” she whispered softly,
“I’m sorry I said what I did. I do see God’s
care and leading now.”</p>

<p>“Dear child,” was the smiling answer as
the wrinkled hand smoothed tenderly the
plump, fair cheek, “never doubt His care and
leading. It is not often this is made so clear
and it never may be to thee again, for we are
commanded to walk by faith and not by sight;
but always be sure that God’s love and care
are ever over thee.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” was the low answer. “I will
never doubt it again.”</p>

<p>“If thee is ever tempted to, and it will be
strange if thee is not—keep this in mind:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
that the Lord’s thought toward thee is always
of love, that He will lay nothing upon
thee that He will not give thee strength to
bear, and no discipline whose right use will
not make thee stronger and better, and the
better fitted for that abundant entrance into
His kingdom which I trust and pray may be
thine.”</p>

<p>Twilight shadows were creeping into the
room, and these two, the young heart just
opening to God’s love, and the aged heart
who had tested it through a long lifetime, sat
hand in hand in the peaceful stillness.</p>

<p>The opening of a door aroused Rose. Silence
Blossom had come in from feeding her
chickens, bringing with her a whiff of the
crisp, outer air. “Well, Rose,” as she held
out her hands to the heat of the fire, “are you
a happy girl to-night?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I am. I thought yesterday when
I knew that the money was found, that I was
happy as I could be; but I am still happier
now. To think that no one can call me a
pauper any more, or twit me with being a
charity child!” Her voice choked, for every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
taunting reference to her poverty had stung
deep, and with all the sensitiveness of a
proud nature she had felt the bitterness of
her dependent condition. “Just to think that
I can pay for what I have, and have an education.
Why, it seems too good to be true. If
it were three millions I don’t believe I could
feel any richer. Of course,” she hurried
to add, “I know I must be very careful,
but I wonder—do you think—that I could
have a new dress, not made over, but one
bought on purpose for me; and a pair of kid
gloves—I don’t know that I could afford
them, but I’ve wanted a pair so long.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Silence Blossom spoke quick and
decisive. “You can have a pair of kid gloves
and a new dress. It can be neat and pretty
without being of expensive material.”</p>

<p>Rose hesitated a moment. “I suppose a
brown or a blue dress would do me the most
service, but I’ve always wished that I could
have a red dress.”</p>

<p>“A red dress it shall be, then,” said Miss
Silence. “And you can help me make it. I
haven’t forgotten how a girl feels about her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
clothes, and as long as I have any say about
it you are going to have things like other
girls.”</p>

<p>Rose drew a blissful breath; she could
hardly believe it possible. In fact, it was a
difficult matter for Rose to go to sleep that
night, she was so overflowing with happiness;
and numberless were the plans as to what she
would do and be, as blissful as they were
vague, that floated through her excited mind
as she lay with her eyes wide open in the
moonlight.</p>

<p>“I wish Ben Pancost could know,” she
whispered. And then for all her happiness
she sighed a little quivering sigh, for since
the day they parted in the little parlor of the
Byfield hotel, not one glimpse had she seen
or one word had she heard of Ben Pancost.
He had neither come to Farmdale at the time
he had appointed, nor in any of the weeks that
followed, though she had watched for him
with eyes that grew weary with watching,
and sometimes were wet with the tears of
disappointment.</p>

<p>Rose could not understand it. Ben had
been so interested in her behalf, he had left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
her so full of anxiety for her welfare, with
such a positive promise of coming to see her.
Nor could she doubt him. If ever she felt inclined
to do so, the remembrance of all his
kindness, of all he had been to her in the time
of her sore need would come afresh to her
mind. She had but to shut her eyes to see
again the merry, sunburned face, with the
straightforward, honest eyes, so full of sympathy,
and to feel the tight clasp of his warm,
brown hand as he slipped the silver dollars
into it. One of these she had never spent
and whenever she looked at it there came the
certainty that Ben could not have failed her;
something must have happened, and what that
was she could not imagine. Rose seldom
mentioned Ben to Mrs. Blossom or Silence,
because they both inclined to the opinion that
being but a boy some fresher interest had
crowded the matter from his mind. But Mrs.
Patience believed with her that he was not a
boy to lightly break a promise, and that he
would have come if he could.</p>

<p>“I wish more than ever that I could see
Ben Pancost,” she confided to Mrs. Patience
when her first check arrived, “for now I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
could pay him back the money he let me have.
And Ben works hard for his money, and he
may need it. If I knew where he was I would
write and send it to him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Rose!” Mrs. Patience’s sense
of propriety was delicate and old-fashioned.
“It would hardly be proper for a young girl
to write to a boy.”</p>

<p>“But this would be different,” urged Rose.
“It would be business, paying a debt.”</p>

<p>“That would make a difference,” admitted
Mrs. Patience, “for a lady would not
wish to rest under an obligation of that kind
if she could avoid it. But then you do not
know where he is.”</p>

<p>“No,” admitted Rose sadly, for brief as
her acquaintance with Ben Pancost had been
its circumstance had made it one of the most
vivid memories of her life; and the day spent
with him, as she looked back on it, seemed to
her almost like a page out of fairyland, with
Ben himself, warm-hearted, sympathetic,
loyal Ben, with his happy self-confidence and
happier confidence in God, as its knight and
hero.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>

<p>Then Rose’s face brightened. “For all
that, I have a feeling that I shall meet Ben
again, sometime.”</p>

<p>“He may be dead,” suggested Mrs. Patience,
whose own bereavement sometimes
gave a tinge of melancholy to her sweet nature.</p>

<p>“Then he has gone to heaven,” was Rose’s
quick answer, “and if when I die I go there,
too, I shall be sure to meet him.”</p>

<p>A few days later Rose came in with her arm
full of school books. “Those are my books
for next term,” as she spread them proudly
on the table.</p>

<p>“The history is not new,” remarked Silence
Blossom as she glanced them over.</p>

<p>“No; Clara Brown used it last year. But
it is not much soiled and she let me have it
fifty cents cheaper than a new one, and I have
a particular use for that fifty cents.”</p>

<p>With that Rose went up to her room and
after a time came down with an open letter
in her hand. “I’ve been writing to Mrs. Hagood,
and I’d like to read it to you, and have
you tell me if it’s all right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“‘<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,’<br>
</p>

<p>“I thought first I wouldn’t say ‘dear,’”
she explained, “for she never was dear to
me, one little bit; but I thought it would be
polite to, and I wanted to be polite.</p>

<p>“‘Perhaps you think that I ought not to
have taken those things to eat when I left
your house, though they were not much more
than I would have eaten at the supper which
I did not have, and the basket I put them in
was an old grape basket. So I send you fifty
cents, which is all everything is worth, and
more, too!’</p>

<p>“Fifty cents was all Ben paid for my dinner
the next day, and it was a fine dinner.</p>

<p>“‘I am living with a very nice family who
are so kind to me. Mrs. Blossom found my
relatives, and my real name is not Posey
Sharpe, but Rose Shannon. My grandmother
had left me property, so I am not a
charity child any more, but have money of
my own to pay for my board and clothes, and
an education. I like Farmdale, and have
good friends here. The paper I am writing
on is from a box given me at Christmas.’”</p>
</div>

<p>She paused and looked from one to another.
“Will that do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>“I didn’t hear any regret for the way you
left Mrs. Hagood,” said Mrs. Blossom.</p>

<p>“No, nor you won’t hear any. I know I
didn’t do right, but if she had done what was
right herself it wouldn’t have happened. If
I’d said anything, I should have said that,
so I thought perhaps I’d better not say anything.
I’ve always felt she might say that I
took what didn’t belong to me, and I’m only
too glad to send her the money. I would
have liked to have added something to Mr.
Hagood, but I was afraid if I did it would
make trouble for him. She will be apt to
read the letter to him, and he will be glad to
know I am so nicely settled, but it will make
her feel pretty bad to know that I can pay
for my board and she not get the money,”
and Rose gave a chuckle.</p>

<p>“How did you sign yourself?” asked Miss
Silence, who had been biting her lips to keep
from laughing.</p>

<p>“I just signed my name. I wasn’t going to
say ‘Yours truly,’ or ‘sincerely,’ for I’m not
hers, and it’s one of the joys of my life that
I never shall be.” And Rose folded the letter
into its envelope and patted on the stamp.</p>

</div>

<p>It was some two weeks after Great-Uncle
Samuel’s visit that the stage one day stopped
at the Blossom’s. “Rose Shannon live
here?” the driver asked. “Here’s a box for
her I found over at Byfield.”</p>

<p>“A box for me?” cried Rose, circling
round it. “Who in the world can it be
from?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps when we open it we will know,”
and Silence brought the hatchet and quickly
had the cover loose. “There’s a letter,”
as she lifted the lid. “No doubt that will
tell.”</p>

<p>Rose unfolded the letter and read it in silence.
Then she handed it to Mrs. Blossom.
“It’s from my Great-Aunt Sarah; you
can read it out loud.” Her cheeks were red,
but she spoke quietly, so quietly that Mrs.
Blossom glanced at her keenly as she took the
letter and read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">
“<span class="smcap">My Dear Niece</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>“I have had a letter from Samuel Jarvis
in which he writes that there is no question
but you are the daughter of Kate Jarvis, and
as he is a careful man I dare say it is so. The
minister who was written to, and who married
Kate came to me first and I referred him
to Samuel, for being a man he could better
look after the matter.</p>

<p>“He also wrote me the arrangement he had
made for you. I am glad to know that you
are with a worthy family, and I trust they
will look after your manners—manners are so
important for a young girl. Your mother’s
manners were considered attractive, but she
was headstrong. I hope you are not headstrong.
I must say that under the circumstances,
with no one to look after and his
brother’s grandchild, I should have thought
Samuel Jarvis would have taken charge of
you himself. But Samuel never did consider
anything but his own selfish ease and pleasure
and I suppose he is too old to look for
any change now. I myself am a nervous
wreck, so I could not possibly have you with
me.</p>

<p>“As I know that you have but little money
and will need to be very careful, with this letter
I am sending you some things that if you
are at all capable you can make over and use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
for yourself; the stockings you can cut over,
and the slippers were always too small for
me.</p>

<p>“Samuel Jarvis wrote me about the Bible
I gave your mother. I remember it well, and
am pleased to know that you have kept it.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>No one made a remark as Mrs. Blossom
finished the letter, till Miss Silence spoke,
“Well, let us see what’s in the box.”</p>

<p>The contents were quickly taken out, for
even Grandmother Sweet would have confessed
to a curiosity in the matter. These
were an old black velvet dress worn threadbare
at the seams and trimmed with beaded
fringe; a soiled black and white check wool
wrapper; a black satin skirt shiny with wear;
a purple silk with coffee stains down the front
breadth; some brown brocaded material which
had evidently served as lining to a cloak; a
bundle of half-worn stockings; several yards
of black feather trimming, moth-eaten in
spots; a pair of fancy bedroom slippers; and
at the bottom of the box a plush cape heavily
braided with a bugle trimming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>Hardly a word had been uttered as one by
one the garments had been unfolded. Rose
had knelt among them in silence; now she
drew the cape about her and rose to her feet.
For a moment she looked down at herself,
then tearing the cape off she gave it a throw
and sank back in a little heap on the floor.
“I know it would be comfortable,” she wailed,
“and I need it, and it would save spending
money, but I can’t wear that cape with those
bugles, I can’t.”</p>

<p>Silence Blossom was laughing. “You
needn’t wear it, Rose,” she said soothingly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Patience had lifted the cape and was
examining it, “That was an expensive garment,
when it was new.”</p>

<p>“It might have been, <em>when</em> it was new,”
retorted her sister.</p>

<p>“What am I to do with the stuff?” questioned
Rose with a tragic gesture toward the
unfolded garments scattered round her. “I’ve
a good mind to pack it in the box again and
send it straight back to Great-Aunt Sarah!”</p>

<p>“No, no, Rose,” reproved Mrs. Blossom;
“remember she is your aunt.”</p>

<p>“I do remember.” Rose’s eyes were sparkling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
with angry tears. “I used sometimes
to imagine what it would be like if I should
ever find my relatives and have real aunts
and uncles and cousins, who cared for me.
Well, I have found them,” and she drew a
sobbing breath. “I have a Great-Uncle Samuel
and a Great-Aunt Sarah; and neither one
cares that for me,” and she gave a snap to
her fingers, “and neither one will have me—though
I’m glad Great-Aunt Sarah doesn’t
want me. But I shall love Great-Uncle Samuel
always, even if I never see him again, because
he did take enough interest to come
and see me, and plan things for me. When
I was Posey, I was nobody’s Posey; and now
I’m Rose, I’m nobody’s Rose!”</p>

<p>“You are our Rose,” and Mrs. Patience
put her arms about her, “and the Fifields
think you are their Rose. I will tell you
what you can do. You can win the love of
people for yourself, and so be everybody’s
Rose.”</p>

<p>Rose suddenly smiled. “I never thought
of that before, but I will do it. And Grandmother
Sweet shall tell me how, for everybody
loves her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>But Grandmother shook her head. “That
is something thee will have to learn for thyself.
Only I will tell thee one thing, if thee
would win love thee must first give love;
whatever thee would get out of life thee must
first put into life.”</p>

<p>Miss Silence had been going over the things
again with her practised eye. “See here,
Rose, we can wash up this black and white
check and it will make you a good school
dress, with a color for piping to brighten it.
And I have been looking at the black velvet
and I’m quite sure I can get you a little coat
out of it. We can use the brocade for lining,
and there will be plenty of feather trimming,
even when the bad spots are taken out. That
will look nicely with your new red dress.”</p>

<p>“And I will make you a little black velvet
turban, and trim it with red ribbon to match
your dress,” added Mrs. Patience.</p>

<p>“And I will show you how to put new feet
in the stockings.” Grandmother Sweet had
drawn one on her hand. “They are a good,
fine quality.”</p>

<p>Rose looked from one to another. “What
should I have done if I hadn’t come here?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
You know just what to do every time. And
when the world looks all grey, if it isn’t quite
black, if I can see it through your eyes, why
it’s pink and rosy again.”</p>

<p>As Rose was saying this she gathered up
the articles and put them back in the box
once more. “I suppose you can find a use
for this purple silk. Perhaps when I’m old
and wear a cap it will come useful.”</p>

<p>For answer Miss Silence laughed and
nodded, “There will be some place where it
will come in yet.”</p>

<p>“Rose,” said Mrs. Blossom, “I think it is
time the chickens were fed.”</p>

<p>This was something Rose had begged to
do. They were a tamer flock than Mrs. Hagood’s,
petted as was every living thing about
the Blossoms, and it was an unfailing pleasure
to have them run to meet her, to feed
them out of her hand, and to smooth their
white feathers as they crowded around. As
she took the measure of yellow corn from the
back of the stove where it had been warming,
the big Maltese cat rose and purred beside
her. “No, Dandy,” and she gave him a pat,
“you can’t go with me this time, the chickens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
don’t like you; you jump and make them
flutter.”</p>

<p>As she spoke she looked for something to
put around her and her eye fell on the cape
which lay this time on the top of the box.
“I have just thought what I can use it for,”
and she laughed merrily. “I can wear it out
to the chicken house; the chickens, I know,
will enjoy pecking at the bugles. That would
certainly be making use of it.”</p>

<p>She paused with her hand on the door.
“Will I have to write to Great-Aunt Sarah
and thank her?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think that you ought to?” Mrs.
Blossom questioned in turn.</p>

<p>“I am not sure whether I do or not. But
one thing is certain—if I do write to her you
will all have to help me, for I should never
know what to say.”</p>

<p>“I know what I should like to say to her.”
Silence Blossom’s tone was scornful, though
she waited till Rose was out of hearing before
she spoke. “I would like to tell her
that such a lot of good-for-nothing old stuff
I never saw sent away. I have heard stories
of the boxes sent to some of the home missionaries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
out West, and I think this must be
like them. Any woman of sense might have
known that those things were not suitable for
a girl of Rose’s age.”</p>

<p>“At least the material was good,” urged
her mother.</p>

<p>“You mean it had been, but it was past that
point. It’s very evident that Great-Aunt
Sarah buys good clothes for herself. Something
new for Rose for a dress would have
done her more good than all that cast-off
finery.”</p>

<p>“To my mind the letter was worse than
the box,” declared Mrs. Patience. “I never
heard anything more heartless and cold-blooded.
One would have thought the mere
facts would have aroused a sympathy for
Rose.”</p>

<p>“She is coming in,” cautioned Miss Silence,
“and we would not say anything before
her. But this much is certain, that I
know all I want to of Mrs. Sarah Hartly.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br>
<span class="fs80">QUIET DAYS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>You may have seen a little leaf that has
fallen into a stream and been whirled along
by the unresting current, torn and bruised
and helpless, then suddenly drift into a still
and quiet pool and lie tranquil, unvexed,
while the stream, unable longer to clutch it,
goes hurrying by. So to Rose, after her troubled,
changeful childhood, Farmdale was the
quiet pool, where she was to find a quiet, uneventful
period.</p>

<p>Not that Rose ever thought of it as uneventful.
To her school life she brought an
enthusiasm that never flagged; the school
tests, the class competitions, the school entertainments,
the school games, and even the
school differences, she entered into them all
heart and soul. She studied hard, she took
eager advantage of every opportunity, and
was none the less ready for every enjoyment
with the keen zest of her intense nature.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
Then outside the school was the village with
all its people and all their happenings, a little
world of itself. “Some of the girls call
Farmdale dull and poky,” she repeated wonderingly
to Miss Silence. “I’m sure it isn’t
dull to me—I don’t see how they can think
it is.”</p>

<p>The Blossom household quickly became
home, and home folks to Rose. But when
Mrs. Blossom promised for her the same care
she would have given her own little Rachel,
she included also, what she would have expected
of little Rachel had she lived, as she
had of her other daughters, the yielding of a
ready, cheerful obedience. Mrs. Blossom’s
law was one Rose had known little of, the law
of love, but none the less was it law. Never
in their girlhood, and hardly in their maturer
years, had Silence or Patience Blossom
dreamed of acting in opposition to their
mother’s will—that reasonable, mild, but inflexible
will. And though Rose had not hesitated
to face Mrs. Hagood’s fury, yet when
those clear, steadfast eyes looked into hers,
and that kindly but firm voice said, with its
accent of decision, “Rose, you cannot!” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
instinctively realized that here was a force,
the force of moral strength, that impetuous
willfulness would beat powerless against.
Nor was her affection for Mrs. Blossom any
the less sincere because of the obedient respect
on which it was founded.</p>

<p>Great-Uncle Samuel had been rightly informed
that the Farmdale high school was a
good one, and the lessons Rose learned within
its walls were to her of value; but no less so
was the unconscious teaching of the pure and
unselfish lives that were open before her
every day. Over an ardent young life, full
of dreams and plans and ambitions, all centered
in self, a happier influence could not
well have fallen than that of these gentle,
kindly women, whose spirit of helpfulness
and sympathy was always as ready and unfailing
as the flow of the fountain itself.</p>

<p>Was any one in distress, in perplexity, in
trouble; there was no counselor so wise, discreet,
trustworthy, as Mrs. Blossom, who held
half the village secrets, and had served as a
peacemaker times without number. Was
there a bride to be dressed; no one could do
it so well as Miss Silence or Mrs. Patience.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
Was any one sick; no nurses were as tender
and skillful and tireless as they. Did the
shadow of death rest over a home; no voices
could speak words of sweeter comfort to the
dying, no other’s presence was so unobtrusive,
so helpful in the house of bereavement. Indeed,
few were the families in that little community
to whom they were not bound by the
cords of a common sympathy in some hour of
joy or grief. And Rose was not the only one
who often wondered how with all the calls
upon them they still managed to accomplish
so much, and with a manner so unhurried.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you ever do it,” Rose exclaimed
one day.</p>

<p>“It’s the busy people who find not only the
most time but the most happiness,” was Silence
Blossom’s cheery answer.</p>

<p>And realizing, as she well did, how much
more of real happiness there was in the modest
Blossom home than in the big Fifield
house, where no one ever thought of going to
ask a service, and every life was wholly self-centered,
Rose could not but admit that this
was true.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what happiness you could find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
in sitting up all night with Aunt Polly
Brown,” she protested. “I’m sure I never
want to go where there’s sick people. I hope
I’ll never be asked to.”</p>

<p>Already in that home where thoughtfulness
for others was part of the daily life, and interest
in any who were suffering a matter of
course, it had come about naturally that Rose
should be sent with a handful of flowers, or
some dainty for a sick neighbor, or was asked
to call at the door with a message of inquiry.
So the next day she took it as a matter of
course when Miss Silence asked her to take a
bowl of chicken broth to Aunt Polly Brown.</p>

<p>“Take it right in to Aunt Polly,” said the
young woman who opened the door. “She’s
in the bedroom right off the sitting-room.”</p>

<p>Rose hesitated. She would have refused
if she had known exactly how to do so. As
it was, the bowl trembled a little as she walked
through into the bedroom, where on a high
four-post bedstead, under a “blazing star”
quilt, Aunt Polly lay, a ruffled night cap surrounding
her shrunken face.</p>

<p>“Well, now,” as Rose told her errand, “it
was reel kind of Silence Blossom to send the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
broth. I was just thinkin’ that a taste o’
chicken broth would relish. Sit down, won’t
ye,” with a wistful accent, “and tell me
what’s goin’ on? Mary Jane never knows
nothin’. Mebby I ain’t goin’ to get well, but
’tany rate I like to know what folks is doin’.”</p>

<p>“I was standing on one foot wondering
how quick I could get out,” Rose said, relating
it all to Miss Silence, on her return.
“But when she spoke that way I just thought
that if I were old and sick I’d be glad to have
somebody come in; and I sat down and racked
my brain to tell everything I could think of.
She seemed real cheered up when I came
away, and I promised her I’d come again.”</p>

<p>“I thought you never wanted to go where
there were sick people,” and Silence Blossom’s
eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>“Well, it wasn’t so bad as I thought it was
going to be, though her hands are kind of
skinny. And I don’t think I feel quite as I
did about sick folks now. Besides, it must
be dreadful to lie in bed day after day, and if
I can make a little of the time pass, why I’m
glad to.”</p>

<p>“There is where the gladness comes in,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
said Mrs. Patience. “It is making the hours
of suffering a little brighter, a little easier.
And now you have learned this I think you
will never forget it.”</p>

<p>“And I also remember that I promised to
come down to Helen Green’s to get out my
Latin with her,” and gathering an armful of
books Rose hurried away.</p>

<p>“I am glad that Rose went in to see Aunt
Polly; she is such a bit of sunshine that she
could not help but do her good. Besides, she
has always had such a morbid dread of a
sick room,” Silence remarked as she watched
her away.</p>

<p>“I am glad, too,” agreed Mrs. Blossom,
“for Rose can gain as well as give. Of
course I would not want her to go where there
was any danger, but her exuberant young nature
will be made the deeper and richer for
being stirred and lifted out of itself.”</p>

<p>So among the threads of interest running
from the Blossom home Rose knit her threads.
The people of Farmdale became her friends,
and because they were her friends she loved
them, and so it was not strange that she won
love in return. With the Fifields her relations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
through the years continued of the
friendliest. On her part the painfulness of
being falsely accused had faded away; and
on their part the fact that it had been an unjust
charge had not only made them one and
all feel that they owed her something in return,
but had awakened an interest in her
that otherwise they might never have felt.
Miss Eudora regarded her in the light of a
romance; Miss Jane Fifield commended the
fact that she was neither vain, nor, as she was
pleased to put it, “silly”; while Mr. Nathan,
in his pride at Rose’s persistence, and the
quality he called her “grit,” went so far as
to freshen up the languages of his college
days, that he might the more help her.</p>

<p>At their time of life it was not to be expected
that the Fifield nature would greatly
change; still their friendship for Rose, inexperienced
young girl though she was, brought
a new and wholesome atmosphere into the
old house. Her flitting in and out, bright,
breezy, vivacious, was a welcome break in
their old formality. A part of Rose’s nature
was her overflowing enthusiasm on the subject
then in mind; her studies, her school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
pleasures, whatever part was hers in the life
of the village, was all shared with her friends.
So when she came in beaming with excitement
over the prettiness of the newest Banby
baby, Miss Fifield and Miss Eudora became
conscious that Mrs. Banby was a neighbor.
Or if it were anxiety how little Mrs. Mather,
whose husband had just died and left her
with five children, was ever going to get
through the winter; or rejoicing that Fanny
Barber, who had been so low with inflammatory
rheumatism was really improving, almost
before they were aware, they would find
themselves becoming interested, an interest
that could easily take the form of a bundle
of warm clothing for the widow, or a glass
of Miss Fifield’s famous quince jelly for the
invalid. And so by the slight touches of
Rose’s hands they found themselves drawn
gradually from their cold isolation, and
nearer to those about them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br>
<span class="fs80">A VISIT FROM AN OLD FRIEND</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Through Cousin Allen Gloin’s wife’s sister,
who lived in Horsham, Rose occasionally
heard of the Hagoods, and the year after she
left there was surprised by the news of Mrs.
Hagood’s death.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hagood takes it real hard,” added
her informant, “and says he don’t know how
he’s ever going to get along without Almiry.
Some folks thinks it’s put on, but for my part
I don’t.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” had been Rose’s answer, “I
think he had grown so used to her ordering
him around that now he does feel lost without
it.”</p>

<p>It was not quite two years later when one
day, returning from school, Rose found a
horse and buggy standing at the Blossom
gate. This of itself was nothing unusual, for
the business of Mrs. Patience and Miss Silence
brought a large share of the Farmdale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
people, as well as those outside its limits, to
their door. But as Rose gave a second look
in passing at the fat old horse and stout
buggy, she suddenly realized that she had
known both before, and quickening her steps
she rushed into the house to find Mr. Hagood,
with Rover sitting upright beside him,
waiting her coming. His was the same familiar
figure she remembered so well—thin,
grizzled, slightly stooping; but Rose saw almost
in the first glance, that his motions were
brisker than in the days when she had known
him, that his whiskers had been trimmed, that
his hat brim had taken an upward tendency,
and his eyes had lost their furtive, timid
glance; in short, that there had been a change
in the whole man, slight but still palpable, in
the direction of cheerful, self-assertive manhood.</p>

<p>“Well, now, Posey,” was his greeting, as
he held both her hands and smiled till his
face was all a-crinkle, “if it don’t beat natur’
how you’ve growed! An’ prettier than ever,
I declare! I tell you I was reel tickled when
I heerd how well you was fixed, an’ that you’d
found out your reel name, an’ your ma’s relations.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
You don’t look much like the little
girl Almiry brought home with her from the
Refuge.”</p>

<p>“And that you gave the russet apples to?”
Rose’s eyes were twinkling, but the tears
were very near them as she recalled that day
of her arrival at the Hagood home.</p>

<p>“So I did, to be sure. Well, Posey—if you
hev got another name you’ll always be Posey
to me—we did hev some good times together,
didn’t we?”</p>

<p>Then they talked over the pleasant memories
of their companionship, with a mutual
care avoiding those whose suggestiveness
might be the opposite. The only allusion he
made to her leaving was, “Rover an’ me did
miss you dreadfully when you went away, we
just did. An’ so to-day, as I had to come
over this way, I said to Rover, ‘We’ll stop
an’ see Posey, we will.’ I’m glad we did,
too, an’ I just believe Rover knows you.”
And Rover, with his head on Rose’s knee and
her hand smoothing his silky ears, gently
thumped his tail on the floor, as if in affirmative.</p>

<p>Then, after a moment’s hesitation, “I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
sorry you an’ Almiry couldn’t fit together
better; she meant well, Almiry did, but you
know she’d never had any little girls of her
own.” And as if fearful that he had cast
some reflection on her memory he hastened
to add, “Almiry was a wonderful woman.
I tell you I met with a big loss when I lost
her, I just did, an’ for a spell I was about
broke up.” He paused with the query, “I
s’pose you’d heard she was dead?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I never heard the particulars.
Was she sick long?”</p>

<p>“No; it come so onexpected it just about
floored me, it did. You see she was taken
with a chill, an’ she kep’ a gettin’ colder’n
colder, in spite o’ everythin’ we could giv’
her, an’ do for her. Why, it did seem that
what with the hot things we give her to drink,
an’ the hot things we kep’ around her, that
if she’d been a stone image ’twould a warmed
her through; but they didn’t do a mite o’
good, not one mite. She was took early one
morning, an’ late the next night I was warmin’
a flannel to lay on her. I het it so ’twas
all a-smokin’, but she couldn’t feel nothin’,
an’ she give it a fling, an’ riz half up in bed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
an’ spoke, just as natural as she ever did,
‘Elnathan Hagood, I don’t believe you’ve hed
that nigh the stove; what ails you that you
can’t half do a thing? I’ve a good mind to
get up and heat some flannel as it ought to
be done. I won’t hev any till I do.’ An’ with
that she fell right back on her piller, an’
never breathed ag’in. I tell you I was all
broke up.”</p>

<p>Rose did not know what she ought to say,
so she said nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. Hagood hesitated, cleared his throat,
and remarked in an inquiring tone, “Mebby
you’ve heard that I was married again?”</p>

<p>It was Rose’s turn to be surprised. “No,
indeed, I’ve heard nothing from Horsham
since Mrs. Gloin’s sister left there. But I’m
glad if you have.”</p>

<p>“Be you really?” his face brightening.
“Well, now, you see,” with the confidential
tone Rose remembered so well, “mebby some
folks’ld think I hadn’t orter done such a
thing. But I tell you after a man has had a
home as many years as I had it’s kinder tough
to be without one. I couldn’t live alone;
Rover an’ I tried that, an’ everything got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
messed up dreadful; keepin’ a hired girl
wasn’t much better; an’ to eat my victuals at
somebody else’s table didn’t seem reel natural,
now it didn’t.</p>

<p>“I thought if Almiry knew all the circumstances
she wouldn’t blame me none ef I did
marry. An’ there was Mirandy Fraser, Jim
Fraser’s widow—don’t know as you ever
knew her, a mighty pretty little woman—she
was havin’ a hard time to get along with her
two little girls, for Jim never was noways
forehanded. So I figured it out that she
needed a home, an’ I needed some one to
make a home; an’ the long an’ short of it is
I married her. An’ the plan’s worked first
rate, well now it has. She ain’t such a manager,”
he admitted, “as Almiry was; but
then,” with a touch of pride, “I don’t suppose
it would be easy to find Almiry’s equal
there. But I’ll say this, I never did see Mirandy’s
match for bein’ pleasant. I don’t believe
anybody ever heerd her speak cross, I
really don’t. She’s so contented, too, with
everything; hasn’t given me the first fault-findin’
word yet, not the first one.”</p>

<p>“How nice that is!” Rose rejoined heartily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>“An’ the little girls,” all the lines on Mr.
Hagood’s face deepened into a tender smile
as he spoke of them, “Susy an’ Ruth, I just
wish you could see them; there never were
two prettier-behaved children, if I do say it.
They like to come out an’ sit in the shop when
I’m at work there, just as you used to, an’,
well, they an’ Rover an’ me has some pretty
good times together.”</p>

<p>Rose smiled. “I don’t believe they enjoy
it any more than I did.”</p>

<p>“I don’t work so much in the shop,
though,” he added, “for I’ve a good deal to
look after. I’m over this way now on business.
The fact of the matter is,” an accent
of dejection creeping into his tone, “I’ve
made a bad bargain. Ever since Almiry
went I’ve kept everything up straight as a
string, an’ haven’t lost a dollar till now. I
s’pose she’d say it was all my fault, an’ so it
is,” growing more and more depressed; “for
I suppose I ought to hev known better than
to hev ever lent Tom Hodges a hundred
dollars. When he moved away from Horsham
he couldn’t pay me, but he’d got a
good place as foreman in a mill, an’ promised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
it all right. That was eight months ago, an’
I’ve never seen a single cent, so I made up
my mind I’d go over there an’ look him up,
an’ I found Tom to-day down with the rheumatism,
not able to do a stroke o’ work, an’
they looked in pretty bad shape—well, now
they did. Of course he couldn’t pay me, said
he hadn’t but two dollars in money, but there
was a cow, I could take that towards it ef I
wanted to. But bless you, there was four
little children who would hev to go without
milk ef I took the cow, an’ I told Tom I’d
wait on him till he could earn the money,
which just the same as meant that I’d give
it to him, for crippled up as he is he can’t
more’n take care of his family. An’ when
I come away I handed his wife five dollars;
she looked as though she needed it, an’
they’ve both always done as well as they
could. I don’t know what Almiry’d say ef
she could know it. But hang it all!” giving
his hat a slap on his knee, “Mirandy said not
to be hard on ’em, an’ it won’t kill me ef I do
lose it.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t stay all night,” in answer to
Rose’s invitation. “I brought Mirandy an’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
the little girls to my Cousin Em’ly’s, ten mile
from here, an’ they’ll be lookin’ for me back.
But I wish you’d come an’ see us, Posey,”
as he rose to go. “I’ve told Mirandy about
you, an’ she’d do everything to make it pleasant.
We haven’t changed things any to
speak of since you was there, only we live
more in the front part o’ the house. I
couldn’t help feelin’ at first that Almiry
wouldn’t like it, but I wanted to make it
pleasant for Mirandy an’ the children, an’
you know it wasn’t what you could call reel
cheerful in that back kitchen.”</p>

<p>“And can Rover come in the house now?”
asked Rose.</p>

<p>“Yes, Rover comes in, an’ we hev the
front blinds open, an’ evenin’s last winter
we’d hev apples an’ nuts an’ popcorn, ’most
as though it was a party. You know,” with
a broad smile, “I never had any children o’
my own before, an’ I sort o’ enjoy havin’
some little girls to call me ‘Pa.’”</p>

<p>Rose had come out along the walk with Mr.
Hagood. As they paused at the gate he
glanced around to be sure that no one but
her could hear him, then lowering his voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
as though fearing it might reach the ears of
the departed Mrs. Hagood, he added confidentially,
“An’ to tell the truth, Posey, just
betwixt you and me, I never was so happy
before in my life as I be now.”</p>

<span class="fs80">AND COLLEGE NEXT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It was the third May that Rose had been
in Farmdale. The turf on the open green
was emerald velvet, the orchards were drifts
of pink and white, the lilacs by Mrs. Blossom’s
gate were lifting spikes of lavender,
and shrubs and roses were heavy with the
weight of bud or bloom. In a swift rush
Rose came down the walk, the white gate
clashed behind her, and she dashed into the
house, rosy and breathless with haste, waving
a long envelope over her head.</p>

<p>“What do you think that is?” she cried.</p>

<p>Miss Silence glanced up from her sewing
machine. “It looks to me like an envelope.”</p>

<p>“And what do you think is inside it?” pursued
Rose.</p>

<p>“A letter is usually inside an envelope,”
answered Mrs. Patience.</p>

<p>“You won’t guess,” pouted Rose, “so I
shall have to tell you, for I couldn’t possibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
keep it. This is my certificate that I have
passed the teachers’ examination I went to
last week, and am duly qualified to teach.
Wish me joy!”</p>

<p>“But I thought thee went to the examination
simply for the practice,” said Grandmother
Sweet.</p>

<p>“So I did. But all the same I wanted to
pass, and was so afraid I wouldn’t pass.
That’s why I didn’t say more about it. And
now that I have a really, truly certificate to
teach! I’m sure I’ve grown an inch since I
took it out of the post-office.”</p>

<p>“We are very glad you succeeded,” and
Mrs. Patience held off a hat to see if the
bunch of flowers was in the right place.</p>

<p>“And that isn’t all,” Rose went on
blithely. “You need sixteen points to graduate
from the high school, I have fourteen
already, because I’ve taken extra studies;
to pass the teachers’ examination counts
two points, so now I can graduate this
year.”</p>

<p>“But why do you want to graduate this
year? I supposed of course you were going
one more,” and Silence looked her surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<p>“I want to get to teaching. I’m just crazy
to begin.”</p>

<p>“Rose, Rose,” Mrs. Blossom in the next
room had heard the conversation, and now
stepped to the doorway, “you are too young
to think of teaching; even if you are qualified
you have not the self-control a teacher
needs.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t say that!” groaned Rose,
“when I have struggled with my temper, and
prayed over it, and counted a hundred before
I spoke, and bitten my tongue till it
bled, and did all the things I ever heard of to
hold on to myself.”</p>

<p>“And you have done very well,” commended
Mrs. Blossom. “You have overcome
much, and learned some hard lessons
in the bridling of your quick tongue, and holding
in check your temper. But you have still
more to learn, especially if you are going
to teach. I know, for I was a teacher myself,
and while text-books and methods change,
boys and girls, as far as I can see, remain
about the same.”</p>

<p>“All I ask is the chance to try some boys
and girls.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>“Besides,” Mrs. Blossom’s voice was
calmly even, “I do not think you can teach,
that any school board would hire a girl of
seventeen.”</p>

<p>“But I know people who have taught when
no older than that,” persisted Rose.</p>

<p>“That might have been once but it is not
now. Indeed I am quite sure that a law has
been passed in Ohio that a teacher cannot
draw pay unless she is over eighteen.”</p>

<p>“It is a mean old law,” scorned Rose.</p>

<p>“Another thing,” continued Mrs. Blossom,
“your Uncle Samuel is your guardian, and
he did not expect, any more than we did,
that you would leave school till next year;
and before taking such a step you must consult
him.”</p>

<p>“Great-Uncle Samuel won’t care,” urged
Rose, “and I’ve set my heart on getting
through this year. Besides if I can’t teach
I can go to school another year, and take
Latin and German, and review the common
branches.”</p>

<p>“You write to Mr. Jarvis first, and see
what he says,” and Rose knew further argument
was useless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>Rose waited and fretted for two weeks before
an answer to her letter came, and when
she read it she gave a gasp of surprise.
“What do you think?” she exclaimed.
“Great-Uncle Samuel says I have been a
very prudent girl, while from my marks—you
know I have sent them to him every
quarter—I seem to have made good use of my
opportunities; so if I will continue to be prudent
he thinks there will be money enough
for me to go to college for four years. This
is what he writes: ‘Of course not to a big
expensive college, that would be quite beyond
your means, the Fairville Woman’s College
is the one I have chosen for you. I am told
that it is an excellent school, that the location
is healthy, and the moral tone excellent.
That you will make good use of its benefits
I shall expect. Of course your Aunt Sarah
Hartly ought to have seen to this for you,
but as long as she wouldn’t I have done what
seemed to me the best.’”</p>

<p>“Four years in college, will not that be
fine?” Silence Blossom’s own eyes were
bright with pleasure.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose it will,” Rose spoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
slowly. “But, you know, I never had
thought of such a thing as college being possible
for me; I did not think that there was
money enough for that. Of course I shall
like it, the only thing is it will make me so
old before I get to teaching.”</p>

<p>The older women looked at Rose’s face,
that had never lost its child expression, and
laughed at her words.</p>

<p>“It may be though,” she went on, “that I
can put in extra studies and shorten the
time.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” protested Mrs. Patience, “to
do your best work you do not want to hurry
it.”</p>

<p>Grandmother Sweet stopped her knitting.
“Rose, my husband while a lad served five
years as apprentice to a carpenter. His own
work was of the best, and he often said that
time spent learning to use one’s tools was
time saved. Now, thee is planning to use
books as tools, and the better thee understands
them the better work thee will do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course,” Rose hastened to say,
“now the chance has come to me I wouldn’t
miss it for anything. And I will make the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
best of it, too. I’m going to send right away
and get a prospectus of the college to see
what the entrance requirements are. I’m
not going to be conditioned, and I’d rather
be a little ahead. I had planned anyway to
read Virgil this summer with Mr. Fifield,
and I can study up whatever else is needed.”</p>

<p>“I think if you are going to college this
fall you will need to do some sewing as well
as studying,” suggested Miss Silence.</p>

<p>“Of course I shall. I know I can’t spend
money for a great deal; what I do have I want
neat and in good shape. I’m so glad to know
about it now, for I can plan the dresses I will
need when I graduate from the high school
so I can use them then.”</p>

<p>“How many will you need?” asked Silence
Blossom.</p>

<p>“The other girls say three; a suit for the
Baccalaureate sermon, another for the senior
reception, and the graduating dress.”</p>

<p>“That last will be white, and will answer
for your best white dress all the year, and
if you get a pretty grey for your suit that
will do for fall wear.”</p>

<p>“That makes two new dresses,” reflected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
Rose. “I can’t afford any more, and one
other still to be evolved. I wish the waist
wasn’t so badly worn to the lavender and
white striped silk Great-Aunt Sarah sent in
the last box; it would make a pretty dress,
and I could mend up the cream lace to trim
it.”</p>

<p>Before Rose had ceased speaking Miss Silence
was turning the leaves of a fashion
book. “There is a dress in this last number
that I believe we can copy, and use the purple
silk she sent you once to combine with
it. The solid color will give it character,
and the lace will soften and keep it girlish.”</p>

<p>Rose was looking at the plate. “Yes, that
will be pretty. You are the very Wizard
of Old Clothes. And if there are scraps
enough of silk and lace left I will make a
little hat with purple violets for trimming to
wear with it.”</p>

<p>She paused and lifted an impressive finger.
“But mind this, when I get to earning for
myself I will have some pretty dresses, and
never will I wear any more of Great-Aunt
Sarah’s cast-offs!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Patience smiled indulgently. “You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
are young, Rose, it is only natural you should
feel so. But you know you are denying yourself
now so that day may come.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” Rose nodded. “When I
have had to go without things I wanted and
that other girls did have, I’ve said, ‘Never
mind, you are having an education.’ I expect
to have to say that pretty often when
I get to college—it’s hard to realize that I
am going—but I’m not going to forget that
I’m working for a purpose.”</p>

<p>“And that’s better than fine clothes.”</p>

<p>Rose twisted her face. “I wouldn’t object
to the fine clothes if I could have them. But
I suppose I shall need some dresses for everyday
wear; the blue dress I had last year will
do for that, won’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and there is your green and red
plaid. You can have some separate waists,
too. I’m sure, Rose, we can have your wardrobe
in shape, that if not fine, it will be neat
and tasty.”</p>

<p>“What could I ever have done without you
all?” Rose paused and sighed. “I am glad
that I can go to college. I shall be gladder
the longer I realize it. But I feel that it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
just break my heart to leave here. If I could
only take you all with me or bring the college
to Farmdale.”</p>

<p>“We are glad that you can go to college,
Rose,” Mrs. Blossom’s voice had not quite
its usual firmness, “but you may be sure of
one thing, we shall miss you more than you
will us. But it is a long time till September;
we will not begin the parting yet.”</p>

<p>“And of course I shall come back in vacations;
everybody goes home then, and this is
my home.”</p>

<p>“Do you think a college freshman will remember
how to gather eggs?” asked Mrs.
Patience.</p>

<p>“This one will, you may be sure,” laughed
Rose, “and how to make omelet, and custard,
and cake with them when they are gathered.
It’s a pity Great-Uncle Samuel never
comes so I can show him how you have taught
me to cook.”</p>

<p>It was a busy summer for Rose; she went
over all the studies in which she would be
examined for entrance to college, she sewed
and gathered and tucked and hemmed, and
when the September days came she packed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
her modest wardrobe in her new trunk with
a curious mingling of dread and delight;
dread at leaving the life she knew, the friends
she had proved; delight in the new and wider
world opening before her.</p>

<p>There had been talk of Mrs. Patience going
with Rose, but it had not proved possible, so
when one sunny September day the stage—the
same stage that had brought her to Farmdale,
stopped at the white gate, and her trunk
was strapped on, with a mixture of tears
and smiles the good-bys were said, and Rose
settled herself in the same corner of the
back seat she had occupied on that day which
now seemed so far, far in the past, no longer
a forlorn little figure, dingy, travel worn and
friendless; but a trim young girl in a pretty
grey suit, leaning out and waving her handkerchief
in answer to those waved to her
from nearly every house. For Rose’s
friends included almost every one in Farmdale,
and all her friends were interested in
her start for college.</p>
